<h2>PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION.</h2>


<p>The lectures herewith presented have been prepared in
accordance with the request and appointment of the First
Presidency of the Church. The greater number of the
addresses were delivered before the Theology Class of the
Church University; and, after the close of the class sessions,
the lectures were continued before other Church organizations
engaged in the study of theology. To meet the desire
expressed by the Church authorities,&mdash;that the lectures
be published for use in the various educational institutions
of the Church,&mdash;the matter has been revised, and is now
presented in this form.</p>

<p>In anticipation of probable question or criticism regarding
the disparity of length of the several lectures, it may
be stated that each of the addresses occupied two or more
class sessions, and that the present arrangement of the
matter in separate lectures is rather one of compilation
than of original presentation.</p>

<p>The author's thanks are due and are heartily rendered to
the members of the committee appointed by the First
Presidency, whose painstaking and efficient examination of
the manuscript prior to the delivery of the lectures, has
inspired some approach to confidence in the prospective
value of the book among members of the Church. The
committee here referred to consisted of Elders Francis M.
Lyman, Abraham H. Cannon, and Anthon H. Lund, of
the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles; Elder George Reynolds,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[iv]</a></span>
one of the Presidents of the Presiding Quorum of
Seventy; Elder John Nicholson, and Dr. Karl G. Maeser.</p>

<p>The lectures are now published by the Church, and with
them goes the hope of the author that they may prove of
some service to the many students of the scriptures among
our people, and to other earnest inquirers into the doctrines
and practices of the Church of Jesus Christ of
Latter-day Saints.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Preface to the Tenth Edition.</span></h3>

issuance of the last preceding edition, translations of the
work have been published in Dutch and Japanese.</p>

<h2>THE ARTICLES OF FAITH</h2>

<h3>OF THE CHURCH OF JESUS CHRIST OF LATTER-DAY
SAINTS.</h3>


<p>1. We believe in God, the Eternal Father, and in His Son, Jesus Christ, and in the
Holy Ghost.</p>

<p>2. We believe that men will be punished for their own sins, and not for Adam's
transgression.</p>

<p>3. We believe that through the atonement of Christ, all mankind may be saved, by
obedience to the laws and ordinances of the Gospel.</p>

<p>4. We believe that the first principles and ordinances of the Gospel are:&mdash;(1) Faith in
the Lord Jesus Christ; (2) Repentance; (3) Baptism by immersion for the remission of
sins; (4) Laying on of Hands for the Gift of the Holy Ghost.</p>

<p>5. We believe that a man must be called of God, by prophecy, and by the laying
on of hands, by those who are in authority, to preach the Gospel and administer in the
ordinances thereof.</p>

<p>6. We believe in the same organization that existed in the Primitive Church, viz.:
apostles, prophets, pastors, teachers, evangelists, etc.</p>

<p>7. We believe in the gift of tongues, prophecy, revelation, visions, healing, interpretation
of tongues, etc.</p>

<p>8. We believe the Bible to be the word of God, as far as it is translated correctly; We
also believe the Book of Mormon to be the word of God.</p>

<p>9. We believe all that God has revealed, all that He does now reveal, and we believe
that He will yet reveal many great and important things pertaining to the Kingdom of
God.</p>

<p>10. We believe in the literal gathering of Israel and in the restoration of the Ten
Tribes; that Zion will be built upon this [the American] continent; That Christ will
reign personally upon the earth; and, That the earth will be renewed and receive its
paradisiacal glory.</p>

<p>11. We claim the privilege of worshiping Almighty God according to the dictates of
our own conscience, and allow all men the same privilege, let them worship how, where
or what they may.</p>

<p>12. We believe in being subject to kings, presidents, rulers, and magistrates, in obeying,
honoring, and sustaining the law.</p>

<p>13. We believe in being honest, true, chaste, benevolent, virtuous, and in doing good
to all men; indeed, we may say that we follow the admonition of Paul. We believe all
things, we hope all things, we have endured many things, and hope to be able to endure
all things. If there is anything virtuous, lovely, or of good report or praiseworthy, we
seek after these things.&mdash;Joseph Smith.</p>

<h3>INTRODUCTORY.</h3>


<p><b>1. Importance of Theological Study.</b>&mdash;In the short period
of time that measures the span of mortal existence, it is
not possible for man to explore any considerable portion of
the vast realm of knowledge; it becomes, therefore, the part
of wisdom to select for study the branches that promise to
prove of the greatest worth. All truth is of value&mdash;above
price indeed in its place; yet with respect to their possible
application, some truths are of incomparably greater worth
than are others. A knowledge of the principles of trade is
essential to the success of the merchant; an acquaintance
with the laws of navigation is demanded of the mariner;
familiarity with the relation of soil and crops is indispensable
to the farmer; an understanding of the profound principles
of mathematics is necessary to the engineer and the
astronomer; so too is a practical knowledge of God essential
to the salvation of every human soul that has attained to
powers of judgment and discretion. The value of theological
knowledge, therefore, ought not to be under-rated; it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
is doubtful if its importance can in any way be over-estimated.</p>

<p><b>2. What is Theology?</b>&mdash;The word "theology" is of Greek
origin; it comes to us from <em>Theos</em>, meaning God, and <em>logos</em>&mdash;a
treatise, or discourse, signifying by derivation, therefore,
collated knowledge of Divinity, or the science that
teaches us of God, implying also the relation existing between
the Supreme Being and His creatures. The term is
of very ancient usage, and may be traced to pagan sources.
Plato and Aristotle speak of theology as the doctrine of
Deity and divine things. Concisely defined, theology "is
that revealed science which treats of the being and attributes
of God, His relations to us, the dispensations of His
providence, His will with respect to our actions, and His
purposes with respect to our end."<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p><b>3.</b> It has been held by some as a truth, that theological
knowledge is not properly a subject for analytical and
otherwise scientific treatment on the part of man; that inasmuch
as a true conception of Deity, with which theology has
primarily to deal, must necessarily be based upon revelation
from the source divine, we can but receive such knowledge as
it is graciously given; and that to attempt critical investigation
thereof by the fallible powers of human judgment would be
to apply as a measure of the doings of God the utterly inadequate
wisdom of man. Many truths are beyond the
scope of unaided human reason, and theological facts have
been declared to be above reason; this is true so far as the
same remark might be applied to any other kind of truth;
for all truth, being eternal, is superior to reason in the
sense of being manifest to reason, but not a creation of
reason; nevertheless truths are to be estimated and compared
by the exercise of reason.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span></p>

<p><b>4. The Extent of Theology.</b>&mdash;Who can survey the boundaries
of this science? It deals with Deity&mdash;the fountain of
knowledge, the source of wisdom; with the proofs of the existence
of a Supreme Being, and of other supernatural personalities;
with the conditions under which, and the means
by which, divine revelation is imparted; with the eternal
principles governing the creation of worlds; with the laws of
nature in all their varied manifestations. Primarily, theology
is the science of God and religion; it seeks to present
"the systematic exhibition of revealed truth, the science of
Christian faith and life." But in a more general sense, theology
has to do with other truths than those which are specifically
called spiritual; its domain is co-extensive with
that of truth.</p>

<p><b>5.</b> The industrial pursuits that benefit mankind, the arts
that please and refine, the sciences that enlarge and exalt
the mind, are but fragments of the great though yet uncompleted
volume of truth that has come to earth from a source
of eternal and infinite supply. The comprehensive study
of theology, therefore, would embrace all known truths.
God has constituted Himself as the great teacher;<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> by personal
manifestations or through the ministrations of His
appointed servants, He instructs His mortal children. To
Adam He introduced the art of agriculture,<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> and even
taught by example that of tailoring;<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> to Noah and Nephi
He gave instructions in ship building;<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> Lehi and Nephi
were taught of Him in the arts of navigation;<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> and for their
guidance on the water, as in their journeyings on land, He
prepared for them the Liahona.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> a compass operated by a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
force more effective than that of terrestrial magnetism;
furthermore, Moses received divine instructions in architecture.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p><b>6. Theology and Religion</b>, though closely related, are
by no means identical. A person may be deeply versed in
theological lore, and yet be lacking in religious, and even in
moral traits. Theology may be compared to theory, while
religion represents practice; if theology be precept, then religion
is example. Each should be the complement of the
other; theological knowledge should strengthen religious faith
and practice. As accepted by the Latter-day Saints, theology
comprehends the whole plan of the gospel. "Theology
is ordered knowledge, representing in the region of the
intellect what religion represents in the heart and life of
man."<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> Knowledge may have to do with the intellect only,
and however sublime its import, it may fail to affect the
hardened heart.</p>

<p><b>7. The "Articles of Faith."</b>&mdash;The beliefs and prescribed
practices of most religious sects are usually set forth in formal
creeds. The Latter-day Saints announce no creed as a
complete code of their faith; for while they hold that the
precepts of eternal life are unchangeable, they accept the
principle of continuous revelation as a characteristic feature
of their belief. However, when asked for a concise presentation
of the principal religious views of his people, Joseph
Smith, the first prophet of the Church in the present dispensation,
announced as a declaration of belief the "Articles
of Faith of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints."
These include the more essential and characteristic features
of the gospel as accepted by this Church; but they are not
complete as an exposition of our belief, for by one of the
Articles it is declared, "We believe all that God has revealed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
all that He does now reveal, and we believe that He will yet
reveal many great and important things pertaining to the
Kingdom of God." From the time of their first promulgation,
the Articles of Faith have been accepted by the
people,<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> and on October 6, 1890, the Latter-day Saints, in general
conference assembled, re-adopted the Articles as part of
their guide in faith and conduct. As these Articles of
Faith present the leading tenets of the Church in systematic
order, they suggest themselves as a convenient outline for
our plan of study.</p>

<p><b>8. The Standard Works of the Church</b> form our written
authority in doctrine; but they are by no means our only
sources of information and instruction on the theology of
the Church. We believe that God is as willing to-day as He
ever has been to reveal His mind and will to man, and that
He does so through chosen and appointed channels. We
rely therefore on the teachings of the living oracles of God
as of equal validity with the doctrines of the written word,
the men in chief authority being acknowledged and accepted
by the Church as prophets and revelators, and as being in
possession of the power of the holy Priesthood. The written
works adopted by the vote of the Church as authoritative
guides in faith and doctrine are four,&mdash;the Bible, the Book
of Mormon, the Doctrine and Covenants, and the Pearl of
Great Price. Other works have been and are being issued
by officers and members of the Church, and many such
books are unreservedly sanctioned by the people and their
ecclesiastical authorities; but the four publications named
are the only regularly constituted standard works of the
Church. Of the doctrine treated in the authorized standards,
the Articles of Faith may be regarded as a fair,
though necessarily but an incomplete epitome.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>


<p class="center">JOSEPH SMITH, THE PROPHET.</p>

<p><b>9. Joseph Smith</b>, whose name is appended to the Articles
of Faith, was the prophet through whom the Lord restored
to earth in these the last days the Gospel, and this in accordance
with predictions made in previous dispensations.
The question of the divine authenticity of this man's mission
is an all-important one to earnest investigators of
Latter-day Saint doctrines. If his claims to a God-given
appointment be false, forming, as they do, the foundation
of the Church in the last dispensation, the superstructure
cannot be stable; if, however, his purported ordination under
the hands of heavenly personages be a fact, one need
search no further for the cause of the phenomenal strength
and growing power of the restored Church. The circumstances
of the divine dealings with Joseph Smith, the marvelous
development of the work instituted by this modern
prophet, the fulfilment through his instrumentality of
many of the grandest predictions of old, and his own prophetic
utterances with their literal realizations, will yet be
widely acknowledged as proof conclusive of the validity of
his ministry.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> The exalted claims maintained for him and
his life's work, the fame that has made his name known for
good or evil among most of the civilized nations of the
earth, the vitality and growing strength of the religious
and social systems which owe their origin as nineteenth-century
establishments to the ministrations of this man,
give to him an individual importance warranting at least a
passing consideration.</p>

<p><b>10. His Parentage and Youth.</b>&mdash;Joseph Smith, the third
son and fourth child in a family of ten, was born December
23d, 1805, at Sharon, Windsor County, Vermont. He was
the son of Joseph and Lucy Mack Smith&mdash;a worthy couple,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
who though in poverty lived happily amid their home scenes
of industry and frugality. When the boy, Joseph, was ten
years old, the family left Vermont and settled in the State
of New York, first at Palmyra, and later at Manchester,
Ontario County. At the place last named, the future prophet
spent most of his boyhood days. In common with his
brothers and sisters, he had but little schooling; and for
the simple rudiments of an education, which by earnest application
he was able to gain, he was mostly indebted to his
parents, who followed the rule of devoting a portion of their
limited leisure to the teaching of the younger members of
the household.</p>

<p><b>11.</b> In their religious inclinations, the family favored the
Presbyterian church, the mother and three or four of the
children having united themselves with that sect; but
Joseph, while at one time favorably impressed by the Methodist
creed, kept himself free from all sectarian membership,
being greatly perplexed over the strife and dissensions manifesting
themselves among the churches of the time. He
had a right to expect that in the Church of Christ there
would be unity and harmony; yet in place of such he saw
among the wrangling sects only confusion. When Joseph
was in his fifteenth year, the region of his home was visited
by a storm of fierce religious excitement, which, beginning
with the Methodists, soon became general among all the
sects; there were revivals and protracted meetings, and the
manifestations of sectarian rivalry were many and varied.
These conditions added much to the distress of the young
searcher after truth.</p>

<p><b>12. His Search for Truth and the Result.</b>&mdash;Here is Joseph's
own account of his course of action:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"In the midst of this war of words and tumult of opinions,
I often said to myself, what is to be done? who of all
these parties are right? or, are they all wrong together? If<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
any one of them be right, which is it, and how shall I know
it?</p>

<p>"While I was laboring under the extreme difficulties
caused by the contests of these parties of religionists, I was
one day reading the Epistle of James, first chapter and fifth
verse, which reads, '<em>If any of you lack wisdom, let him
ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth
not, and it shall be given him.</em>'<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> Never did any passage of
scripture come with more power to the heart of man than
did this at this time to mine. It seemed to enter with great
force into every feeling of my heart. I reflected on it again
and again, knowing that if any person needed wisdom from
God, I did; for how to act I did not know, and unless I
could get more wisdom than I then had, would never know,
for the teachers of religion of the different sects understood
the same passage so differently as to destroy all confidence
in settling the question by an appeal to the Bible. At
length I came to the conclusion that I must either remain
in darkness and confusion, or else I must do as James directs,
that is, ask of God. I at length came to the determination
to ask of God, concluding that if He gave wisdom
to them that lacked wisdom, and would give liberally and
not upbraid, I might venture. So, in accordance with this
my determination to ask of God, I retired to the woods
to make the attempt. It was on the morning of a beautiful
clear day, early in the spring of 1820. It was the first time
in my life that I had made such an attempt, for amidst all
my anxieties I had never as yet made the attempt to pray
vocally.</p>

<p>"After I had retired to the place where I had previously
designed to go, having looked around me and finding myself
alone, I kneeled down and began to offer up the desires
of my heart to God. I had scarcely done so, when immediately
I was seized upon by some power which entirely overcame
me, and had such astonishing influence over me as to
bind my tongue so that I could not speak. Thick darkness
gathered around me, and it seemed to me, for a time, as if I
were doomed to sudden destruction. But, exerting all my
powers to call upon God to deliver me out of the power of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
this enemy which had seized upon me, and at the very moment
when I was ready to sink into despair and abandon
myself to destruction, not to an imaginary ruin, but to the
power of some actual being from the unseen world, who had
such a marvelous power as I had never before felt in any being;
just at this moment of great alarm, I saw a pillar of
light exactly above my head, above the brightness of the
sun, which descended gradually until it fell upon me. It
no sooner appeared than I found myself delivered from
the enemy which held me bound. When the light rested
upon me, I saw two personages, whose brightness and glory
defy all description, standing above me in the air. One of
them spake unto me calling me by name, and said (pointing
to the other), '<em>This is my beloved Son, hear Him.</em>'"<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p></blockquote>

<p><b>13.</b> In answer to his prayer for guidance as to which of the
sects was right, he was told to join none of them, for all
were wrong, with their creeds which are an abomination in
the sight of God, and their professors who are corrupt, in
that they draw near with their lips while their hearts are far
from the Lord, teaching for doctrine the commandments of
men, having a form of godliness while denying the power
thereof.</p>

<p><b>14.</b> Such knowledge as has been communicated in this
unprecedented revelation was not to be held secret within
the heart of the youth. He hesitated not to impart the
glorious truths, first to the members of his family, who received
his testimony with reverence, and then to the sectarian
ministers, who had labored so diligently to convert
him to their several creeds. To his surprise, these
professed teachers of Christ treated his statements with
the utmost contempt, declaring that the day of revelation
from God had long since passed away; and that the
manifestation, if indeed he had received any such at all, was
surely from Satan. Nevertheless, the ministers exerted themselves,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
with a unity of purpose strangely at variance with
their former hostility toward one another, to ridicule the
young man, and to denounce his testimony. The neighborhood
was aroused; persecution, bitter and vindictive, was
waged against him and his family; he was actually fired
upon by a would-be assassin: yet through it all he was preserved
from bodily injury; and in spite of increasing opposition
he remained faithfully steadfast to his testimony
of the heavenly visitation.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> In this condition of trial, he
continued without further manifestation for three years,
constantly expecting, but never receiving the additional
light and added instructions for which he yearned. He was
keenly sensitive of his own frailty and conscious of human
weaknesses. He pleaded before the Lord, acknowledging
his errors and craving help.</p>

<p><b>15. Angelic Visitations.</b>&mdash;On the night of September
21st, 1823, while praying for forgiveness of sins and for
guidance as to his future course, he was blessed with
another heavenly manifestation. There appeared in his
room a brilliant light, in the midst of which stood a personage
clothed in white, and with a countenance of radiant
purity and loveliness. The celestial visitor announced himself
as Moroni, a messenger sent from the presence of God;
and then he proceeded to instruct the youth as to some of the
Divine purposes in which Joseph was to take a most important
part. The angel said that through Joseph as the
earthly instrument the true Church would be again established
upon the earth; that his name would be known
among all nations and tongues, honored by the good, reviled
by the wicked; that a record, engraven on plates of gold,
giving a history of the nations that had formerly lived upon
the western continent and an account of the Savior's ministrations
among the people on this land, was hidden in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
hill near by; that with the plates were two sacred stones,
known as Urim and Thummim, by the use of which, men in
olden times had become seers, and that through those instruments
God would enable Joseph to translate the record
engraved on the plates.</p>

<p><b>16.</b> The angelic messenger then repeated several prophecies
which are recorded in the ancient scriptures; some of
the quotations were given with variations from our Bible
readings. Of the words of Malachi the following were
quoted: "For behold, the day cometh that shall burn as
an oven, and all the proud, yea, and all that do wickedly,
shall burn as stubble, for they that come shall burn them,
saith the Lord of Hosts, and it shall leave them neither
root nor branch."<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> And further:&mdash;"Behold, I will reveal
unto you the Priesthood by the hand of Elijah the prophet,
before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the
Lord. And he shall plant in the hearts of the children the
promises made to the fathers, and the hearts of the children
shall turn to their fathers; if it were not so, the whole earth
would be utterly wasted at his coming."<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> Among other
scriptures, Moroni cited the prophecies of Isaiah relating
to the restoration of scattered Israel, and the promised reign
of righteousness on earth,<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> saying that the predictions were
about to be fulfilled; also the words of Peter to the Jews,
concerning the prophet who Moses said would be raised up,
explaining that the prophet referred to was Christ, and that
the day was near at hand when all who rejected the words
of the Savior would be cut off from among the people.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p><b>17.</b> Having delivered his message, the angel departed,
the light in the room seeming to condense about his person,
and disappearing with him. But the heavenly visitant returned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
a second and a third time during the night, each
time repeating the instructions, with additional admonitions
as to the requirements, and warnings regarding temptations
that would assail the youthful seer. On the following day,
Moroni appeared to Joseph again, reciting anew the instructions
and cautions of the preceding night, and telling him to
acquaint his father with all he had heard and seen. This
the boy did, and the father promptly testified that the communications
were from God.</p>

<p><b>18.</b> Joseph soon repaired to the hill described to him in
the vision. He recognized the spot indicated by the angel,
and with some labor laid bare a stone box containing the
plates and other things spoken of by Moroni. The heavenly
messenger again stood beside him, and forbade the removal
of the contents at that time, saying that four years were to
elapse before the plates would be committed to his care, and
that it would be his duty to visit the spot at yearly intervals.
On the occasion of each of these visits the angel instructed
the young man more fully regarding the great work awaiting
him.</p>

<p><b>19.</b> It is not the purpose of the present lecture to review
in detail the life and ministry of Joseph Smith;<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> so much
attention has been given to the opening scenes of his
divinely-appointed mission, in view of the unusual importance
associated with the ushering in of the modern or new
dispensation of God's providence. The bringing forth of
the plates from their resting-place of centuries, their translation
by divine power, and the publication of the record as
the Book of Mormon, shall receive attention on a later occasion;
for the present it is sufficient to say that the ancient
record has been translated; that the Book of Mormon has
been given to the world; and that the volume is accepted as
scripture by the Latter-day Saints.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>
<p><b>20. Later Developments: the Martyrdom.</b>&mdash;In due time,
the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints was organized,
the Priesthood having been restored through the
ordination of Joseph Smith by those who had held the keys
of that authority in former dispensations. From an initial
membership of but six persons, the Church grew to include
thousands during the life-time of the Prophet Joseph; and
the growth has continued with phenomenal rapidity and
stability until the present time. One by one the powers
and authorities possessed by the Church of old were restored
through the man who was chosen and ordained to be
the first elder of the latter-day dispensation. With the
spread of the Church, persecution increased, and the effect
of evil opposition reached a climax in the cruel martyrdom
of the prophet, and his brother Hyrum, then patriarch of
the Church, June 27, 1844. The incidents leading up to
and culminating in the foul murder of these men at
Carthage, Illinois, are matters of common history. Suffice
it to say that prophet and patriarch gave the sacred seal
of their life's blood to the testimony of the truth, which
they had valiantly maintained in the face of intolerant
persecution for nearly a quarter of a century.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p><b>21. Authenticity of Joseph Smith's Mission.</b>&mdash;The evidence
of divine authority in the work established by Joseph Smith,
and of the justification of the claims made by and for the
man, may be summarized as follows:</p>

<p>I. Ancient prophecy has been fulfilled in the restoration
of the gospel and the re-establishment of the Church upon
the earth through his instrumentality.</p>

<p>II. He received by direct ordination and appointment, at
the hands of those who held the power in former dispensations,
the authority to minister in the various ordinances of
the gospel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>III. His possession of the power of true prophecy, and of
other spiritual gifts, is shown by the results of his ministry.</p>

<p>IV. His doctrines are both true and scriptural.</p>

<p>Each of these classes of evidence will receive attention and
find ample demonstration in the course of our study of the
Articles of Faith; and a detailed consideration will not be
attempted at this stage of our investigation; a few illustrations,
briefly stated, however, may not be out of place.</p>

<p><b>22. I. The Fulfilment of Prophecy</b>, wrought through the
life work of Joseph Smith, is abundantly shown. John the
Revelator, from his prophetic vision of the latter-day dispensation,
understood and predicted that the gospel would
be again sent from the heavens, and be restored to the earth
through the direct ministration of an angel:&mdash;"And I saw
another angel fly in the midst of heaven, having the everlasting
gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth,
and to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people."<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>
A partial fulfilment of this prediction is claimed in the
manifestation of the angel Moroni to Joseph Smith, as
already described, whereby the restoration of the gospel was
announced, and the speedy realization of other ancient prophecies
was promised; and a record, described in part as
containing "the fulness of the everlasting gospel," was committed
to his care for translation and publication among all
nations, kindred, and tongues. The remainder of John's fateful
utterance, regarding the authorized call for repentance
and the execution of God's judgment preparatory to the awful
scenes of the last days, is now in process of rapid and literal
fulfilment.</p>

<p><b>23.</b> Malachi predicted the coming of Elijah specially
commissioned with power to inaugurate the work of co-operation
between the fathers and the children, and announced
this mission as a necessary preliminary to the advent of "the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
great and dreadful day of the Lord."<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> The angel Moroni
confirmed the truth and significance of this prediction in an
emphatic reiteration.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> Joseph Smith and his associate in
the ministry, Oliver Cowdery, solemnly testify that they
were visited by Elijah the prophet, in the temple at Kirtland,
Ohio, on the third day of April, 1836; on which
occasion the heavenly messenger declared that the day
spoken of by Malachi had fully come; "Therefore," continued
he, "the keys of this dispensation are committed into your
hands, and by this ye may know that the great and
dreadful day of the Lord is near, even at the doors."<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> The
particular nature of the union of the fathers and the children,
upon which both Malachi and Moroni laid great stress,
has been explained as consisting in the work of vicarious
ordinances, including baptism for the dead who have passed
from earth without a knowledge of the gospel. In teaching
this doctrine, and in complying with its behests, the
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints stands to-day
alone amongst all the sects professing Christianity.</p>

<p><b>24.</b> The ancient scriptures are teeming with prophecies
concerning the restoration of Israel in the last days, and
the gathering of the chosen people from among the nations
and from the lands into which they have been led or driven
as a penalty for their waywardness and sin.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> Such prominence
and importance are attached to this work of gathering,
in the predictions of olden times, that from the days of
Israel's exodus, the last days have been characterized in
sacred writ as a gathering dispensation. The return of the
tribes after their long and wide dispersion is made a preliminary
work to the establishment of the predicted reign<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
of righteousness with Christ on the throne of the world;
and its accomplishment is given as a sure precursor of the
millennium. Jerusalem is to be re-established as the City of
the Great King on the eastern Hemisphere; and Zion, or the
New Jerusalem, is to be built on the western continent; the
Ten Tribes are to be brought back from their hiding place
in the north; and the curse is to be removed from Israel.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>
From the early days of Joseph Smith's ministry, he taught
the doctrine of the gathering as imposing a present duty
upon the Church; and this phase of the Latter-day Saint
labor is one of its most characteristic features. Joseph
Smith and Oliver Cowdery declare that the authority for
prosecuting this work was committed to the Church through
them by Moses, who held the keys of authority as Israel's
leader in former times. Their testimony is thus stated, in
the description given of manifestations in the Kirtland
Temple, April 3, 1836:&mdash;"Moses appeared before us, and
committed unto us the keys of the gathering of Israel from
the four parts of the earth, and the leading of the ten tribes
from the land of the north."<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> As to the earnestness with
which this labor has been begun, and the fair progress already
made therein, consider the hundreds of thousands belonging
to the families of Israel already gathered in the valleys
of the Rocky Mountains, about the house of the Lord, now
established; and hear the hymn of the chosen seed among
the nations, chanted to the accompaniment of effective deeds,
"Come, and let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, and
to the house of the God of Jacob; and He will teach us of
His ways, and we will walk in His paths; for the law shall go
forth of Zion, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem."<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

<p><b>25.</b> The bringing forth of the Book of Mormon is held<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
by the Latter-day Saints to be a direct fulfilment of prophecy.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>
In predicting the humiliation of Israel, to whom
had been committed the power of the priesthood in early
days, Isaiah gave voice to the word of the Lord in this
wise:&mdash;"And thou shalt be brought down, and shalt speak
out of the ground, and thy speech shall be low out of the
dust, and thy voice shall be, as of one that hath a familiar
spirit, out of the ground, and thy speech shall whisper out
of the dust."<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> The Book of Mormon is verily the voice of
a people brought low, speaking from the dust, for from the
dust the book was literally taken. The volume professes
to be the history of but a small division of the house of
Israel,&mdash;a part of the family of Joseph indeed, who were
led by a miraculous power to the western continent six
centuries prior to the Christian era. Of the record of
Joseph, and its coming forth as a parallel testimony to that
of Judah, or the Bible in part, the Lord thus spake through
the prophet Ezekiel:&mdash;"Moreover, thou son of man, take
thee one stick, and write upon it, For Judah, and for the
children of Israel his companions: then take another stick,
and write upon it, For Joseph, the stick of Ephraim, and
for all the house of Israel his companions: And join them
one to another into one stick; and they shall become one in
thine hand. And when the children of thy people shall
speak unto thee, saying, Wilt thou not show us what thou
meanest by these? Say unto them, Thus saith the Lord
God; Behold, I will take the stick of Joseph, which is in the
hand of Ephraim, and the tribes of Israel his fellows, and
will put them with him, even with the stick of Judah, and
make them one stick, and they shall be one in mine hand."<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>
The succeeding verses declare that the gathering and restoration<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
of Israel would immediately follow the united
testimony of the records of Judah and Joseph. The two
records are before the world, a unit in their testimony of
the everlasting Gospel; and the work of gathering is in
effective progress.</p>

<p><b>26.</b> It is further evident from the scriptures, that the
dispensation of the Gospel in the latter days is to be one of
restoration and restitution, a "dispensation of the fulness
of times" in very truth. Paul declares it to be the good
pleasure of the Lord, "That in the dispensation of the fulness
of times he might gather together in one all things in
Christ, both which are in heaven, and which are on earth;
even in him."<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> This prediction finds a parallel in an utterance
of the prophet Nephi:&mdash;"Wherefore all things which
have been revealed unto the children of men, shall at that
day be revealed."<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> And in accord with this is the teaching
of Peter: "Repent ye therefore, and be converted, that
your sins may be blotted out, when the times of refreshing
shall come from the presence of the Lord; And he shall
send Jesus Christ, which before was preached unto you:
Whom the heavens must receive until the times of restitution
of all things, which God hath spoken by the mouth of all his
holy prophets since the world began."<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> Now comes Joseph
Smith with the declaration that unto him has been given
the authority to open up this, the dispensation of fulness,
restitution, and restoration; and that through him the
Church has been endowed with all the keys and powers of
the priesthood, held and exercised in earlier periods: Unto
the Church "is the power of this priesthood given, for the
last days, and for the last time, in the which is the dispensation
of the fulness of times, which power you hold in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
connection with all those who have received a dispensation
at any time from the beginning of creation."<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> The actual
possession of these combined and unified powers is sufficiently
proved by the comprehensive work of the Church in
its present scope of operation.</p>

<p><b>27. II. Joseph Smith's Authority</b> was conferred upon
him by direct ministrations of heavenly beings, each of whom
had once exercised the same power upon the earth. We
have already seen how the angel Moroni, formerly a mortal
prophet among the Nephites, transmitted to Joseph the appointment
to bring forth the record which he, Moroni, had
buried in the earth over fourteen hundred years before. We
learn further, that on the 15th of May, 1829, the lesser or
Aaronic Priesthood was conferred upon Joseph Smith and
Oliver Cowdery by the hand of John the Baptist,<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> who came
in his immortalized state with that particular order of priesthood
which comprises the keys of the ministrations of angels,
the doctrine of repentance and of baptism for the remission
of sins. This was the same John who, with the voice of one
crying in the wilderness, had preached the self-same doctrine,
and had administered the same ordinance in Judea as the
immediate forerunner of the Messiah. In delivering his
message, John the Baptist stated that he was acting under
the direction of Peter, James, and John, apostles of the Lord,
in whose hands reposed the keys of the higher or Melchizedek
Priesthood, which in time would also be given. This
promise was fulfilled a month or so later, when the apostles
named manifested themselves to Joseph and Oliver, ordaining
them to the apostleship,<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> which comprises all the offices
of the higher order of priesthood, and which carries authority
to minister in all the established ordinances of the Gospel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p><b>28.</b> Then, some time after the Church had been duly
organized, authority for certain special functions was given,
the appointing messenger being in each case the one whose
right it was so to officiate by virtue of the commission which
he had held in the days of his mortality. Thus, as has been
seen, Moses conferred the authority to prosecute the work
of gathering; and Elijah, who, not having tasted death, held
a peculiar relation to both the living and the dead, delivered
the authority of vicarious ministry for the departed. To
these appointments by heavenly authority should be added
that given by Elias, who appeared to Joseph Smith and
Oliver Cowdery, and "committed the dispensation of the
gospel of Abraham," saying as was said of the Father of the
Faithful and his descendants in olden times, that in them
and in their seed should all succeeding generations be blessed.<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>

<p><b>29.</b> It is evident, then, that the claims made by the
Church with respect to its authority are complete and consistent
as to the source of the powers professed, and the channels
through which such have been delivered again to earth.
Scripture and revelation, both ancient and modern, support
as an unalterable law the principle that no one can delegate
to another an authority which the giver does not possess.</p>

<p><b>30. III. Joseph Smith was himself a true Prophet.</b>&mdash;This
statement, if fully substantiated, would be of itself sufficient
proof of the validity of the claims of this modern prophet,
and the test is not difficult of application. In the days of
ancient Israel, an effective method of trying the claims of a
professed prophet was prescribed:&mdash;"When a prophet speaketh
in the name of the Lord, if the thing follow not, nor
come to pass, that is the thing which the Lord hath not
spoken, but the prophet hath spoken it presumptuously;
thou shalt not be afraid of him."<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> Conversely, if the words<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
of the prophet are made good by fulfilment, there is at least
proof presumptive of his genuineness. Of the many predictions
uttered by Joseph Smith and already fulfilled or
awaiting the set time of their realization, a few citations
will suffice for our present purpose.</p>

<p><b>31.</b> One of the earliest prophecies declared by him, which,
while not his independent utterance but that of the angel
Moroni, was nevertheless given to the world by Joseph Smith,
had special reference to the Book of Mormon, of which the
angel said: "The knowledge that this record contains will go
to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people, under
the whole heaven."<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> This declaration was made four years
before the work of translation was begun, and fourteen years
before the elders of the Church began their missionary labor
in foreign lands. Since that time the Book of Mormon has
been translated into seventeen foreign languages, and is published
in fifteen tongues; and the work is still in progress.</p>

<p><b>32.</b> In August, 1842, while the Church was suffering
persecution in Illinois, and when the western part of the
continent was but little known and only as the territory of
an alien nation, Joseph Smith prophesied "that the Saints
would continue to suffer much affliction, and would be
driven to the Rocky Mountains," and that while many then
professing allegiance to the Church would apostatize, and
others, faithful to their testimony, would meet the martyr's
fate, some would live to "assist in making settlements and
build cities and see the Saints become a mighty people in
the midst of the Rocky Mountains."<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> The literal fulfilment
of this prediction, uttered in 1842, and it may be added,
foreshadowed by an earlier prophecy in 1831,<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> the one five,
the other sixteen years before the migration of the Church<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
to the West, is attested by the common history of the settlement
and development of this once inhospitable region. Even
the skeptic and the pronounced opponents of the Church
admit the miracle of the establishment of a mighty commonwealth
in the valleys of the Rocky Mountains.</p>

<p><b>33.</b> A most remarkable prediction regarding national
affairs was uttered by Joseph Smith, December 25th, 1832;
it was soon thereafter promulgated among the members of
the Church, and was preached by the elders, but did not
appear in print until 1851.<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> The revelation reads in part as
follows:&mdash;"Verily thus saith the Lord, concerning the wars
that will shortly come to pass, beginning at the rebellion of
South Carolina, which will eventually terminate in the death
and misery of many souls. The days will come that war
will be poured out upon all nations, beginning at that place;
For, behold, the Southern States shall be divided against
the Northern States, and the Southern States will call on
other nations, even the nation of Great Britain; ...
And it shall come to pass, after many days, slaves shall rise
up against their masters, who shall be marshalled and disciplined
for war." Every student of United States history
is acquainted with the facts establishing a complete fulfilment,
even to the minutest detail, of this astounding prophecy.
In 1861, more than twenty-eight years after the foregoing
prediction was recorded, and ten years after its publication
in England, the Civil War broke out, beginning in
South Carolina. The ghastly records of that fratricidal
strife sadly support the prediction concerning "the death
and misery of many souls." It is well known that slaves
deserted the South and were marshalled in the armies of the
North, and that the Confederate States solicited aid of Great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
Britain. While no open alliance between the Southern States
and England was effected, the British government gave indirect
assistance and substantial encouragement to the South,
and this in such a way as to produce serious international
complications. Vessels were built and equipped at British
ports in the interests of the Confederacy; and the results of
this violation of the laws of neutrality cost Great Britain the
sum of fifteen and a half millions of dollars, which sum was
awarded the United States at the Geneva arbitration in settlement
of the "Alabama claims." The Confederacy appointed
commissioners to Great Britain and France; these
appointees were forcibly taken by United States officers from
the British steamer on which they had embarked. This act,
which the United States government had to admit as overt,
threatened for a time to precipitate a war between this nation
and Great Britain.</p>

<p><b>34.</b> The revelation cited, as given through Joseph Smith,
contained other predictions, some of which are yet awaiting
fulfilment.<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> The evidence presented is sufficient to prove
that Joseph Smith is prominent among men by reason of his
instrumentality in fulfilling prophecies uttered by the Lord's
representatives in former times, and that his own claim to
the rank of prophet is abundantly vindicated. But the
endowment of prophecy so richly bestowed upon this Elias
of the last days, and so freely yet unerringly exercised by
him, is but one of the many spiritual gifts by which he, in
common with a host of others who have received the priesthood
from him, was distinguished. The scriptures declare
that certain signs shall attend the Church of Christ, among
them the gifts of tongues, healing, immunity from threatening
death, and the power to control evil spirits.<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> The
exercise of these powers, resulting in what are ordinarily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
termed miracles, is by no means an infallible proof of divine
authority; for many true prophets have wrought no such
wonders, and men have been known to work miracles at the
instigation of evil spirits.<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> Nevertheless, the possession of
the power implied by the working of miracles is an essential
characteristic of the Church; and when such acts are
wrought in the accomplishment of holy purposes, they serve
as confirmatory evidence of divine authority. Therefore we
may expect to find, as find we do, in the ministry of Joseph
Smith and in that of the Church in general, the attested
record of miracles, comprising manifestations of all the
promised gifts of the Spirit. This subject will be further
considered on another occasion.<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></p>

<p><b>35. IV. The Doctrines Taught by Joseph Smith</b> and by the
Church to-day are true and scriptural. To sustain this
statement we must examine the principal teachings of the
Church in separate order. The Articles of Faith furnish us
a convenient summary of many of the doctrines pertaining
to the latter-day work; and these we will proceed to study
in the course of the lectures that are to follow.</p>


<h4>NOTES.</h4>

<blockquote>

<p><b>1. The "Articles of Faith"</b> date from March 1, 1841. They constitute a
portion of a letter from the Prophet Joseph Smith to a Mr. Wentworth, of Chicago.
The "Articles" were published in the History of Joseph Smith: (See <cite>Millennial Star</cite>,
vol. XIX, p. 120; also <cite>Times and Seasons</cite>, vol. III, p. 709.) As stated elsewhere, the
Articles have been formally adopted by the Church as an authorized summary of its
principal doctrines.</p>

<p><b>2. Joseph Smith's Early Persecution.</b>&mdash;The Prophet wrote as follows
concerning the persecution of his boyhood days, which dated from the time of
his first mention of his vision of the Father and the Son:&mdash;"It has often caused
me serious reflection, both then and since, how very strange it was that an obscure boy,
a little over fourteen years of age, and one too who was doomed to the necessity of
obtaining a scanty maintenance by his daily labor, should be thought a character of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
sufficient importance to attract the attention of the great ones of the most popular sects
of the day, so as to create in them a spirit of the hottest persecution and reviling. But
strange or not, so it was, and was often cause of great sorrow to myself. However, it was,
nevertheless, a fact that I had had a vision. I have thought since that I felt much like Paul
when he made his defense before King Agrippa, and related the account of the vision he
had when he saw a light and heard a voice, but still there were but a few who believed him;
some said he was dishonest, others said he was mad, and he was ridiculed and reviled;
but all this did not destroy the reality of his vision. He had seen a vision, he knew he
had, and all the persecution under heaven could not make it otherwise; ... So it
was with me; I had actually seen a light, and in the midst of that light I saw two personages,
and they did in reality speak unto me, or one of them did; and though I was
hated and persecuted for saying that I had seen a vision, yet it was true; and while they
were persecuting me, reviling me, and speaking all manner of evil against me, falsely,
for so saying, I was led to say in my heart, Why persecute for telling the truth? I had
actually seen a vision, and who am I that I can withstand God?" <cite>Pearl of Great Price</cite>:&mdash;Extracts
from the History of Joseph Smith: 23-25.</p>

<p><b>3. Tribute to Joseph Smith.</b>&mdash;While few people outside the Church have had
much to say in commendation of this modern prophet, it is interesting to note that there
are some honorable exceptions to the rule. Josiah Quincy, a prominent American, made
the acquaintance of Joseph Smith a short time before the latter's martyrdom; and after
the tragic event he wrote: "It is by no means improbable that some future text-book, for
the use of generations yet unborn, will contain a question something like this: What
historical American of the nineteenth century has exerted the most powerful influence
upon the destinies of his countrymen? And it is by no means impossible that the answer
to that interrogatory may be thus written: <em>Joseph Smith, the Mormon Prophet</em>. And the
reply, absurd as it doubtless seems to most men now, may be an obvious commonplace to
their descendants. History deals in surprises and paradoxes quite as startling as this.
The man who establishes a religion in this age of free debate, who was and is today
accepted by hundreds of thousands as a direct emissary from the Most High,&mdash;such a rare
human being is not to be disposed of by pelting his memory with unsavory epithets....
The most vital questions Americans are asking each other today have to do with this man
and what he has left us.... Burning questions they are, which must give a prominent
place in the history of the country to that sturdy self-asserter whom I visited at Nauvoo,
Joseph Smith, claiming to be an inspired teacher, faced adversity, such as few men have
been called to meet, enjoyed a brief season of prosperity, such as few men have ever
attained, and, finally, forty-three days after I saw him, went cheerfully to a martyr's
death. When he surrendered his person to Governor Ford, in order to prevent the shedding
of blood, the Prophet had a presentiment of what was before him. 'I am going like
a lamb to the slaughter,' he is reported to have said, 'but I am as calm as a summer's
morning. I have a conscience void of offence, and shall die innocent.'" <cite>Figures of the
Past</cite> by Josiah Quincy, p. 376.</p>

<p><b>4. The Seal of Martyrdom.</b>&mdash;"The highest evidence of sincerity that a man can
give his fellow-men,&mdash;the highest proof that he has spoken the truth in any given case&mdash;is
that he perseveres in it unto death, and seals his testimony with his blood.... So
important did such a testimony become in the estimation of Paul, that he said 'Where a
testament is there must also of necessity be the death of the testator. For a testament is
of force after men are dead: otherwise it is of no strength at all while the testator liveth.'
(Heb. ix, 16-17.) In the light of this principle, and when the importance of the great
testimony which he bore to the world is taken into account, it is not to be wondered at
that Joseph Smith was called upon to affix the broad seal of martyrdom to his life's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
work. Something of incompleteness in his work would likely have been complained of
had this been lacking; but now, not so; his character of prophet was rounded out to complete
fulness by his falling a martyr under the murderous fire of a mob at Carthage in
the State of Illinois."&mdash;Elder B. H. Roberts, in "<cite>A New Witness for God</cite>," pp. 477-478.</p>

<p><b>6. Joseph Smith's Descent.</b>&mdash;"Joseph Smith was of humble birth. His parents
and their progenitors were toilers, but their characters were godly and their names unstained.
Near the middle of the seventeenth century Robert Smith, a sturdy yeoman of
England, emigrated to the New World, the land of promise. With his wife, Mary, he
settled in Essex, Massachusetts. The numerous descendants of these worthy people
intermarried with many of the staunchest and most industrious families of New England.
Samuel, the son of Robert and Mary, born January 26th, 1666, wedded Rebecca Curtis,
January 25th, 1707. Their son, the second Samuel, was born January 26th, 1714; he
married Priscilla Gould, and was the father of Asael, born March 1st, 1744. Asael Smith
took to wife Mary Duty, and their son Joseph was born July 12th, 1771. On the 24th of
January, 1796, Joseph married Lucy Mack at Tunbridge in the State of Vermont. She
was born July 8th, 1776, and was the daughter of Solomon and Lydia Mack, and was the
granddaughter of Ebenezer Mack."&mdash;<cite>The Life of Joseph Smith, the Prophet</cite>, by George
Q. Cannon; Chapter I. Joseph the Prophet was the third son and fourth child of Joseph
and Lucy (Mack) Smith; he was born at Sharon, Vermont, December 23d, 1805.</p>

<p><b>7. The Standard Works of the Church.</b>&mdash;The Bible and the Book of
Mormon&mdash;the first two of the standard works of the Church&mdash;are to receive attention in
later lectures (see pp. 240-307). The Doctrine and Covenants is a compilation of modern
revelations as given to the Church in the present dispensation. The <cite>Pearl of Great Price</cite>
comprises the visions and writings of Moses as revealed to Joseph Smith, the Book of
Abraham&mdash;a translation by Joseph Smith from certain ancient papyri&mdash;and some of the
writings of Joseph Smith.</p>

<p><b>8. History of the Restored Church.</b>&mdash;Further information regarding
the life work of Joseph Smith, and the growth of the Church of Jesus Christ as
restored to earth through his instrumentality, may be found in the "History of the
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints," Salt Lake City, Utah. For a brief
synopsis of Church history see "The Story of Mormonism," by James E. Talmage,
Liverpool, 1907; Salt Lake City, 1910.</p>

<p><b>9. Restoration of the Gospel.</b>&mdash;Plainly the vision-prophecy of John (Rev.
xiv, 6, 7), relating to the restoration of the gospel to earth, could not refer to the
gospel record preserved in the Holy Bible, for that record has remained in the
possession of mankind. As stated in our text (page 14) a partial fulfilment is
found in the visitation of Moroni and the restoration of the Book of Mormon,
which is to us of modern times a new scripture, and one containing a fuller
record of "the everlasting gospel." However, a record of the gospel is not the
gospel itself. Authority to administer in the saving ordinances of the gospel is
essential to the effective preaching and administration thereof; this was restored
through John the Baptist, who brought the Aaronic Priesthood, and through Peter,
James, and John who brought again to earth the Melchizedek Priesthood (see
pp. 193, 194 herein). For commentary on Rev. xiv, 6, 7, see "The Great
Apostasy," p. 168.</p></blockquote>

<h3>GOD AND THE GODHEAD.</h3>

<p><b>Article 1.</b>&mdash;We believe in God, the Eternal Father, and in His Son, Jesus Christ,
and in the Holy Ghost.</p></blockquote>


<p><b>1. The Existence of God.</b>&mdash;Since faith in God constitutes
the foundation of religious belief and practice, and inasmuch
as a knowledge of the attributes and character of
Deity is essential to an intelligent exercise of faith in Him,
this subject claims first place in our study of the doctrines
of the Church.</p>

<p><b>2.</b> The existence of God is scarcely a question of rational
dispute; nor does it call for proof by the feeble demonstrations
of man's logic, for the fact is admitted by the human
family practically without question, and the consciousness
of subjection to a supreme power is an inborn
quality of mankind. The early scriptures are in no sense
devoted to a primary demonstration of God's existence, nor
to attacks on the sophistries of atheism; and from this fact
we may infer that the errors of doubt developed in
some period later than the first. The universal assent
of mankind to the existence of God is at least a strongly
corroborative truth. There is a filial passion within
human nature which flames toward heaven. Every nation,
every tribe, every individual, yearns for some object of
reverence. It is natural for man to worship; his soul
is unsatisfied till it finds a deity. When men through
transgression first fell into darkness concerning the true
and living God, they established for themselves other deities;
and so arose the abominations of idolatry. And yet,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
terrible as these practices are, even the most revolting
idolatries testify to the existence of a God by declaring
man's hereditary passion for worship. Plutarch has wisely
remarked of ancient conditions: "If you search the
world, you may find cities without walls, without letters,
without kings, without money; but no one ever saw a
city without a deity, without a temple, or without prayers."
This general assent to a belief in the existence
of Deity is testimony of a high order; and in this connection
the words of Aristotle may be applied:&mdash;"What
seems true to some wise men is somewhat probable; what
seems true to most or all wise men is very probable; what
most men, both wise and unwise, assent to, still more
resembles truth; but what men generally consent in has the
highest probability, and approaches so near to demonstrated
truth, that it may pass for ridiculous arrogance and
self-conceitedness,
or for intolerable obstinacy and perverseness,
to decry it."<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p>

<p><b>3.</b> The multiplicity of evidence upon which mankind
rest their conviction regarding the existence of a Supreme
Being, may be classified, for convenience of consideration,
under the three following heads:</p>

<p>I. The evidence of history and tradition.</p>

<p>II. The evidence furnished by the exercise of human
reason.</p>

<p>III. The conclusive evidence of direct revelation from
God Himself.</p>

<p><b>4. I. History and Tradition.</b>&mdash;History as written by man,
and tradition as transmitted from generation to generation
prior to the date of any written record now extant, give evidence
of the actuality of Deity, and of close and personal
dealings between God and man in the first epochs of human
existence. One of the most ancient records known, the Bible,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
names God as the Creator of all things,<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> and moreover,
declares that He revealed Himself to our first earthly
parents and to many other holy personages in the early
days of the world. Adam and Eve heard His voice<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> in the
Garden, and even after their transgression they continued
to call upon God and to sacrifice to Him. It is plain, therefore,
that they carried with them from the Garden a knowledge
of God. After their expulsion they heard "the voice
of the Lord from the way toward the Garden of Eden,"
though they saw Him not; and He gave unto them commandments,
which they obeyed. Then came to Adam an
angelic messenger, and the Holy Ghost inspired the man
and bare record of the Father and the Son.<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></p>

<p><b>5.</b> Cain and Abel learned of God from the teachings of
their parents, as well as from personal ministrations. After
the acceptance of Abel's offering, and the rejection of that
of Cain followed by Cain's terrible crime of fratricide, the
Lord talked with Cain, and Cain answered the Lord.<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> Cain
must, therefore, have taken a personal knowledge of God
from Eden into the land where he went to dwell.<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> Adam
lived to be nine hundred and thirty years old and many
children were born unto him. Them he instructed in the
fear of God, and many of them received direct ministrations.
Of Adam's descendants, Seth, Enos, Cainan, Mahalaleel,
Jared, Enoch, Methuselah, and Lamech the father of
Noah, each representing a distinct generation, were all living
during Adam's lifetime. Noah was born but a hundred and
twenty-six years after the time of Adam's death, and moreover
lived nearly six hundred years with his father Lamech,
by whom he was doubtless instructed in the traditions concerning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
God's personal manifestations, which Lamech had
learned from the lips of Adam. Through the medium of
Noah and his family, a knowledge of God by direct tradition
was carried beyond the flood; and Noah held direct
communication with God,<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> and lived to instruct ten generations
of his descendants. Then followed Abraham, who
also enjoyed direct communion with the Creator,<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> and
after him Isaac, and Jacob or Israel, among whose descendants
the Lord wrought such wonders through the instrumentality
of Moses. Thus, had there been no written
records, tradition would have preserved and transmitted a
knowledge of God.</p>

<p><b>6.</b> But even if the accounts of the earliest of man's
personal communion with God had become dimmed with
time, and therefore weakened in effect, they could but give
place to other traditions founded on later manifestations of
the Divine personality. Unto Moses the Lord made Himself
known, not alone from behind the curtain of fire and
the screen of clouds,<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> but by direct face to face communication,
whereby the chosen high-priest beheld even "the
similitude" of his God.<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> This account of direct communion
between Moses and God, in part of which the
people were permitted to share,<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> as far as their faith and
purity permitted, has been preserved by Israel through all
the generations of the past. And from Israel the traditions
of God's existence have spread throughout the world; so
that we find traces of this ancient knowledge even in the
most fanciful and perverted mythologies of heathen nations.</p>

<p><b>7. II. Human Reason</b>, operating upon observations of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
things of nature, strongly declares the existence of God.
The mind, already imbued with the historical truths of the
Divine existence and its close relationship with man, will
find confirmatory evidence in nature on every side; and
even to him who rejects the testimony of the past, and
assumes to set up his own judgment as superior to the common
belief of ages, the multifarious evidences of design in
nature appeal. Every observer must be impressed by the
proofs of order and system among created things, and by
the absence of superfluities in nature. He notes the
regular succession of day and night providing alternate
periods of work and rest for man, animals, and vegetables;
the sequence of the seasons, each with its longer periods of
labor and recuperation, the mutual dependence of animals
and plants, the circulation of water from sea to cloud, from
cloud to earth again, sustaining the fertility of the soil.
As man proceeds to the closer examination of things, he
finds that by study and scientific investigation these proofs
are multiplied many fold. He may learn of the laws
by which earth and its associated worlds are governed
in their orbits; by which satellites are held subordinate to
planets, and planets to suns; he may behold the marvels of
vegetable and animal anatomy, and the surpassing mechanism
of his own body; and with such appeals to his reason
increasing at every step, his wonder as to who made all
this gives place to inexpressible admiration for the Creator
whose presence and power are thus so forcibly proclaimed;
and the observer becomes a worshiper.</p>

<p><b>8.</b> Everywhere in nature is the evidence of cause and
effect; on every side is the demonstration of means adapted
to end. But such adaptations, says a thoughtful writer,
"indicate contrivance for a given purpose, and contrivance
is the evidence of intelligence, and intelligence is the attribute
of mind, and the intelligent mind that built the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
stupendous universe is God."<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> To admit the existence of a
designer in the evidence of design, to say there must be a
contriver in a world of intelligent contrivance, to believe in
an adapter when man's life is directly dependent upon the
most perfect adaptations conceivable, is but to accept self-evident
truths. These axioms of nature ought to require
no demonstration; the burden of proof as to the non-existence
of a God ought to be placed upon him who questions
the solemn truth. "Every house is builded by some man,
but he that built all things is God." So spake the Apostle
of old,<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> and plain as is the truth expressed in these simple
words, there are among men a few who profess to doubt the
evidence of reason, and who deny the Author of their own
being. Strange, is it not, that here and there one, who finds
in the contrivance exhibited by the ant in building her
house, in the architecture of the honey-comb, and in the
myriad instances of orderly instinct among the least of living
things, a proof of intelligence from which man may
learn and be wise, will yet question the operation of intelligence
in the creation of worlds and in the constitution of the
universe?<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a></p>

<p>
<b>9.</b> Man's inborn consciousness tells him of his own
existence; his ordinary powers of observation prove the
existence of others of his kind, and of uncounted orders of
organized beings; from this he concludes that something
must have existed always, for had there been a time of no
existence, a period of nothingness, existence could never
have begun, for from nothing, nothing can be derived. The
eternal existence of something, then, is a fact beyond dispute;
and the question requiring answer is, what is that
eternal something&mdash;that existence which is without beginning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
and without end? The skeptic may answer, "Nature;
matter has always existed, and the universe is but a manifestation
of matter organized by forces operating upon it;
however, Nature is not God." But matter is neither vital
nor active, nor is force intelligent; yet vitality and ceaseless
activity are characteristic of created things, and the effects of
intelligence are universally present. True, nature is not
God; and to mistake the one for the other is to call the edifice
the architect, the fabric the designer, the marble the sculptor,
and the thing the power that made it. The system of
nature is the manifestation of that order which argues a
directing intelligence; and that intelligence is of an eternal
character, coeval with existence itself. Nature herself is a
declaration of a superior Being, whose will and purpose
she portrays in all her varied aspects. Beyond and above
nature, stands nature's God.</p>

<p><b>10.</b> While existence is eternal, and therefore to being
there never was a beginning, never shall be an end, in
a relative sense each stage of organization must have had a
beginning, and to every phase of existence as manifested in
each of the countless orders and classes of created things,
there was a first, as there will be a last; though every ending
or consummation in nature is but the beginning of
another stage of advancement. Thus, man's ingenuity has
invented theories to illustrate, if not to explain, a possible
sequence of events by which the earth has been brought
from a state of chaos to its present habitable condition; but
by those hypotheses, this globe was once a barren ball, on
which none of the innumerable forms of life that now
tenant it could have existed. The theorist therefore must
admit a beginning to earthly life, and such a beginning is
explicable only on the assumption of some creative act, or a
contribution from outside the earth. If he admit the introduction
of life upon the earth from some other and older<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
sphere, he does but extend the limits of his inquiry as to
the beginning of vital existence; for to explain the origin
of a rose-bush in our own garden by saying that it was
transplanted as an offshoot from a rose-tree growing elsewhere,
is no answer to the question concerning the origin of
roses. Science of necessity assumes a beginning to vital
phenomena on this planet, and admits a finite duration of
the earth in its current course of progressive change; and
in this respect, the earth is a representative of the heavenly
bodies in general. The eternity of existence, then, is no
more positive as an indication of an eternal Ruler than is the
endless sequence of change, each stage of which has both
beginning and end. The origination of created things, the
beginning of an organized universe, is utterly inexplicable
on any assumption of spontaneous change in matter, or of
fortuitous and accidental operation of its properties.</p>

<p><b>11.</b> Human reason, so liable to err in dealing with subjects
of lesser import even, may not of itself lead its possessor

wisdom by a long course of wrongdoing, bringing darkness
over his mind in place of light, and ignorance instead of
knowledge. By such a course, the mind becomes depraved
and incapable of appreciating the finer arguments in nature.
A wilful sinner grows deaf to the voice of reason in holy

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p><b>12. III. Revelation</b> gives to man his fullest knowledge of
God. We are not left wholly to the exercise of fallible
reasoning powers, nor to the testimony of others for a
knowledge of the Divine Creator; we may know Him for
ourselves. Instances of God manifesting Himself to His
prophets in olden as in later times are so numerous as to
render impossible any detailed consideration here; moreover,
we will have opportunity of examining many examples
in connection with our study of the ninth of the Articles of
Faith; for the present, therefore, brief mention must suffice.
We have already noted, as the foundation of many traditions
relating to the existence and personality of God, His revelations
of Himself to Adam and other ante-diluvian patriarchs;
then to Noah, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and Moses.
An example but briefly mentioned in the Jewish scriptures
is that of Enoch, the father of Methuselah; of him we read
that he walked with God.<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> From the "Writings of Moses"
we learn that the Lord manifested Himself with special favor
to this chosen seer,<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> revealing unto him the course of events
until the time of Christ's appointed ministry in the flesh,
the plan of salvation through the sacrifice of the Only
Begotten, and the scenes that were to follow until the final
judgment.</p>

<p><b>13.</b> Of Moses we read that he received a manifestation
from God, who spoke to him from the midst of the burning
bush in Mount Horeb, saying: "I am the God of thy father,
the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.
And Moses hid his face, for he was afraid to look upon God."<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a>
Unto Moses and assembled Israel God appeared in a cloud,
with the terrifying accompaniment of thunders and lightnings,
on Sinai: "And the Lord said unto Moses, Thus shalt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
thou say unto the children of Israel, Ye have seen that I
have talked with you from heaven."<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> Of a later manifestation
we are told:&mdash;"Then went up Moses, and Aaron, Nadab,
and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel: And they
saw the God of Israel: and there was under his feet as it
were a paved work of a sapphire stone, and as it were the
body of heaven in his clearness."<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a></p>

<p><b>14.</b> On through the time of Joshua and the judges to
the kings and the prophets, the Lord declared His presence
and His power. Isaiah saw the Lord enthroned in the midst
of a glorious company, and cried out, "Woe is me, for I am
undone; because I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in
the midst of a people of unclean lips, for mine eyes have
seen the King, the Lord of hosts."<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a></p>

<p><b>15.</b> At a subsequent period, when Christ emerged from
the waters of baptism, the voice of the Father was heard
declaring "This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well
pleased."<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> And on the occasion of our Lord's transfiguration,
the same voice repeated this solemn and glorious
acknowledgment.<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> While Stephen was suffering martyrdom
at the hands of his cruel and bigoted countrymen, the

<p><b>16.</b> The Book of Mormon is replete with instances of
communication between God and His people, mostly through
vision and by the ministration of angels, but also through
direct manifestation of the Divine presence. Thus, we read
of a colony of people leaving the Tower of Babel and journeying
to the western hemisphere, under the leadership of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
one who is known in the record as the brother of Jared.
In preparing for the voyage across the great deep, the
leader prayed that the Lord would touch with His finger, and
thereby make luminous, certain stones, that the voyagers
might have light in the ships. In answer to this petition,
the Lord stretched forth His hand and touched the stones,
revealing His finger, which the man was surprised to see
resembled the finger of a human being. Then the Lord,
pleased with the man's faith, made Himself visible to the
brother of Jared, and demonstrated to him that man was
formed literally after the image of the Creator.<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> To the
Nephites who inhabited the western continent, Christ
revealed Himself after His resurrection and ascension. To
these sheep of the western fold, He testified of His commission
received from the Father; showed the wounds in
His hands, feet, and side, and ministered unto the believing
multitudes in many ways.<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a></p>

<p><b>17.</b> In the present dispensation, God has revealed, and
does still reveal himself to His people. We have seen how
by faith and sincerity of purpose Joseph Smith, while
yet a youth, won for himself a manifestation of God's presence,
being privileged to behold both the Father and Christ
the Son.<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> His testimony of the existence of God is not dependent
upon tradition or studied deduction; he declares to
the world that both the Father and Christ the Son live, for
he has beheld their persons, and has heard their voices. In
addition to the manifestation cited, Joseph Smith and his
fellow servant, Sidney Rigdon, state that on the 16th of February,
1832, they saw the Son of God, and conversed with
Him in heavenly vision. In describing this manifestation
they say: "And while we meditated upon these things, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
Lord touched the eyes of our understandings, and they were
opened, and the glory of the Lord shone round about; and
we beheld the glory of the Son, on the right hand of the
Father, and received of His fulness; and saw the holy angels,
and they who are sanctified before His throne, worshiping
God and the Lamb, who worship Him forever and ever.
And now, after the many testimonies which have been given
of Him, this is the testimony last of all which we give of
Him, that He lives, for we saw Him."<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a></p>

<p><b>18.</b> Again, on the 3rd of April, 1836, in the temple at
Kirtland, Ohio, the Lord manifested Himself to Joseph
Smith and Oliver Cowdery, who say of the occasion:&mdash;"We
saw the Lord standing upon the breastwork of the pulpit
before us, and under His feet was a paved work of pure gold
in color like amber. His eyes were as a flame of fire, the
hair of His head was white like the pure snow, His countenance
shone above the brightness of the sun, and His voice
was as the sound of the rushing of great waters, even the
voice of Jehovah, saying,&mdash;I am the first and the last; I am
He who liveth; I am He who was slain; I am your advocate
with the Father."<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a></p>

<p><b>19.</b> These are a few of the testimonies establishing the
fact of direct revelation from God unto men in ancient and
modern times. The privilege of communing with our
Maker is restricted to none; true faith, sincerity of purpose,
and purity of soul will win, for every one who seeks the boon,
the blessing of God's favor and the light of His presence.</p>

<p><b>20. The Godhead: The Trinity.</b>&mdash;Three personages composing
the great presiding council of the universe have
revealed themselves to man: (1) God the Eternal Father;
(2) His Son, Jesus Christ; and (3) the Holy Ghost. That
these three are separate individuals, physically distinct from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
each other, is very plainly proved by the accepted records of
the divine dealings with man. On the occasion of the
Savior's baptism before cited, John recognized the sign of
the Holy Ghost; he saw before him in a tabernacle of flesh
the Christ, upon whom he had performed the holy ordinance;
and he heard the voice of the Father.<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> The three
personages of the Godhead were present, manifesting themselves
each in a different way, and each distinct from the
others. The Savior promised His disciples that the Comforter,<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a>
which is the Holy Ghost, should be sent unto them
by His Father; here again are the three members of the
Godhead distinctly referred to. Stephen, at the time of his
martyrdom, was blessed with the power of heavenly vision,
and he saw Jesus standing on the right hand of God.<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a>
Joseph Smith, while calling upon the Lord in fervent prayer
for wisdom to guide him in his religious professions, saw
the Father and the Son, standing in the midst of light
which shamed the brightness of the sun; one of these declared
of the other, "This is my beloved Son, hear Him."<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a>
Each of the members of the Trinity is called God,<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> together
they constitute the Godhead.</p>

<p><b>21. Unity of the Godhead.</b><a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a>&mdash;The Godhead is a type of
unity in the attributes, powers, and purposes of its members.
Jesus, while on earth<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> and in manifesting Himself to His
Nephite servants,<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> has repeatedly testified of the unity existing
between Himself and the Father, and between them
both and the Holy Ghost. By some this has been construed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
to mean that the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost are
one in substance and in person, that the names in reality
represent the same individual under different aspects. A
single reference to prove the error of this view may
suffice:&mdash;Immediately
before His betrayal, Christ prayed for His disciples,
the Twelve, and other converts, that they should be
preserved in unity,<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> "that they all may be one" as the Father
and the Son are one. It is absurd to think that Christ
desired His followers to lose their individuality and become
one person, even if a change so directly opposed to the laws
of nature were possible. Christ desired that all should be
united in heart, and spirit, and purpose; for such is the
unity between His Father and Himself, and between themselves
and the Holy Ghost.</p>

<p><b>22.</b> This unity is a type of completeness; the mind of
any one member of the Trinity is the mind of the others;
seeing as each of them does with the eye of purity and
perfection, they see and understand alike; under similar
conditions and circumstances each would act in the same
way, guided by the same principles of unerring justice and
equity. The one-ness of the Godhead, to which the scriptures
so abundantly testify, implies no mystical union of
substance, nor any unnatural and therefore impossible
blending of personality; Father, Son, and Holy Ghost are
as distinct in their persons and individualities as are any
three personages in the flesh. Yet their unity of purpose and
operation is such as to make their edicts one, and their will
the will of God. To see one is to see all; therefore said
Christ when importuned by Philip to show them the Father:
"Have I been so long time with you, and yet hast thou not
known me, Philip? he that hath seen me hath seen the
Father; and how sayest thou then, Shew us the Father?
Believest thou not that I am in the Father, and the Father<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
in me? the words that I speak unto you I speak not of
myself: but the Father that dwelleth in me, he doeth the
works. Believe me that I am in the Father, and the Father
in me."<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a></p>

<p><b>23. Personality of Each Member of the Godhead.</b>&mdash;From
the evidence already presented, it is clear that the Father is
a personal Being, possessing a definite form, with bodily
parts, and spiritual passions. Jesus Christ, who was with
the Father<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> in spirit before coming to dwell in the flesh,
and through whom the worlds were made,<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> lived among men
as a man, with all the physical characteristics of a human
being; after His resurrection He appeared in the same form;<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a>
in that form He ascended into heaven;<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> and in that form
He has manifested Himself to the Nephites, and to modern
prophets. Now we are assured that Christ was in the express
image of His Father,<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> after which image man also has
been created.<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> Therefore we know that both the Father and
the Son are in form and stature perfect men; each of them
possesses a tangible body, infinitely pure and perfect, and attended
by transcendent glory, yet a body of flesh and bones.<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a></p>

<p><b>24.</b> The Holy Ghost, called also Spirit, and Spirit of the
Lord,<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> Spirit of God,<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> Comforter,<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> and Spirit of Truth,<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> is

<p><b>25. Some of the Divine Attributes.</b>&mdash;<em>God is Omnipresent</em>:
There is no part of creation, however remote, into which He
cannot penetrate; through the medium of the Spirit the
Godhead is in direct communication with all things at all
times. It has been said, therefore, that God is everywhere
present at the same time; but it is unreasonable to suppose
that the actual person of any one member of the Godhead
can be in more than one place at one time. The senses of
God are of infinite power, His mind of unlimited capacity;
His eye can penetrate all space, His ear can comprehend every
sound; His powers of transferring Himself from place to
place are not limited; plainly, however, His person cannot
be in more than one place at any one time. Admitting the
personality of God, we are compelled to accept the fact of
His materiality; indeed, an "immaterial being," under which
meaningless name some have sought to designate the condition
of God, cannot exist, for the very expression is a contradiction
in terms. If God possesses a form, that form is
of necessity of definite proportions and therefore of limited
extension in space. It is therefore impossible for Him to
occupy at one time more than one space of such limits; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
it is not surprising therefore to learn from the scriptures
that He moves from place to place. Thus we read in connection
with the account of the Tower of Babel, "And the
Lord came down to see the city and the tower."<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> Again,
God appeared to Abraham, and having declared Himself to
be "the Almighty God," He talked with the patriarch, and
established a covenant with him; then we read "And He
left off talking with him, and God went up from Abraham."<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a></p>

<p><b>26.</b> <em>God is Omniscient.</em>&mdash;By Him matter has been organized
and energy directed. He is therefore the Creator of all
things that are created; and "Known unto God are all his
works from the beginning of the world."<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> His power and
His wisdom are alike incomprehensible to man, for they are
infinite. Being Himself eternal and perfect, His knowledge
cannot be otherwise than infinite. To comprehend Himself,
an infinite Being, He must possess an infinite mind. Through
the agency of angels and ministering servants, He is in continuous
communication with all parts of creation, and may
personally visit as He may determine.</p>

<p><b>27.</b> <em>God is Omnipotent.</em>&mdash;He is properly called the Almighty.
Man can discern proofs of the Divine omnipotence
on every side, in the forces that control the elements of
earth, and that guide the orbs of heaven in their prescribed
courses; all are working together for the common good.
There can be no limits to the powers of God; whatever His
wisdom indicates as fit to be done He can and will do. The
means through which He operates may not be of infinite
capacity in themselves; but they are directed by an infinite
power. A rational conception of His omnipotence is power
to do all that He may will to do.</p>

<p><b>28.</b> <em>God is kind</em>, <em>benevolent</em>, <em>and loving</em>, tender, considerate,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
and long-suffering, bearing patiently with the frailties
of His wayward children. He is just, yet merciful in judgment,<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a>
showing favor to all alike, and yet combining with
these gentler qualities a firmness, almost amounting to
fierceness, in avenging wrongs.<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> He is jealous<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> of His own
power and the reverence paid to Him by His children; that
is to say, He is zealous for the principles of truth and purity,
which are nowhere exemplified in a higher degree than in
His personal attributes. This Being is the Author of our
existence, Him we are permitted to approach as Father.
Our faith will increase in Him as we learn of Him.<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a></p>

<p><b>29. Idolatry and Atheism.</b>&mdash;From the abundant evidence
of the existence of Deity, the idea of which is so generally
held by the human family, there would seem to be little ground
on which man could rationally assert and maintain a disbelief
in God; and in view of the many proofs of the benignant
nature of the Divine attributes and disposition, there
ought to be little tendency to turn aside after false and
unworthy objects of worship. Yet the history of the race
shows that theism, which is the doctrine of belief in and
acceptance of, God as the rightful Ruler, is opposed by
many varieties of atheism;<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> and that man is prone to belie
his boast as a creature of reason, and to render his worship
at idolatrous shrines. Atheism is probably a development of
later times, whilst idolatry asserted itself as one of the
early sins of the race. Even at the time of Israel's exodus
from Egypt, God deemed it proper to command by statute,
"Thou shalt have no other gods before me;"<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> yet even
while He wrote those words on the stony tablets, His people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
were bowing before the golden calf which they had fashioned
after the pattern of the Egyptian idol.</p>

<p><b>30.</b> It has been stated that man possesses an instinct for
worship, that he craves and will find some object of adoration.
When man fell into the darkness of continued transgression,
and forgot the Author of his being, and the God
of his fathers, he sought for other deities. Some among
men came to regard the sun as the type of the supreme, and
before that luminary they prostrated themselves in supplication.
Others selected for adoration earthly phenomena;
they marvelled over the mystery of fire, and, recognizing the
beneficent effects of that phenomenon, they worshiped the
flame. Some saw, or thought they saw, in water the emblem
of the pure and the good, and they rendered their devotions
by running streams. Others, awed into reverence by the
grandeur of towering mountains, repaired to these natural
temples, and worshiped the altar instead of Him in whose
honor and by whose power it had been raised. Another
class, more strongly imbued with a reverence for the emblematic,
sought to create for themselves artificial objects
of adoration. They made images and worshiped them; they
hewed uncouth figures from tree trunks, and chiseled
strange forms in stone, and to these they bowed.<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a></p>

<p><b>31.</b> Idolatrous practices in some of their phases came to
be associated with rites of horrible cruelties, as in the custom
of sacrificing children to Moloch, and, among the Hindoos,
to the Ganges; as also in the wholesale slaughtering of
human beings, under Druidical tyranny. The gods that
human-kind have set up for themselves are heartless, pitiless,
cruel.<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p><b>32.</b> Atheism, as before stated, is the denial of the existence
of God; in a milder form it may consist in the mere
ignoring of Deity. But the professed atheist, in common
with his believing fellow-mortals, is subject to man's universal
passion for worship; though he refuse to acknowledge
the true and the living God, he consciously or unconsciously
deifies some law, some principle, some passion of the human
soul, or perchance some material creation; and to this he
turns, to seek, in contemplation of the unworthy object, a
semblance of the comfort which the believer finds in rich
abundance before the throne of his Father and God. I
doubt the existence of a thorough atheist,&mdash;one who with
the sincerity of a settled conviction denies in his heart the
existence of an intelligent Supreme Power. The idea of
God is an essential characteristic of the human soul. The
philosopher recognizes the necessity of such an element in
his theories of being. He may shrink from the open
acknowledgment of a personal Deity, yet he assumes the
existence of a "governing power," of a "great unknown,"
of the "unknowable," the "illimitable," the "unconscious."
Oh, man of learning though not of wisdom! why reject the
privileges extended to you by the omnipotent, omniscient
Being to whom you owe your life, yet whose name you will
not acknowledge? No mortal can approach Him while contemplating
His perfections and might with aught but awe
and speechless reverence; regarding Him only as Creator
and God, we are abashed in thought of Him; but He has
given us the right to approach Him as His children, to
call upon Him by the endearing name of Father! And
even the atheist feels, in the more solemn moments of his
life, a yearning of the soul toward a spiritual Parent, as
naturally as his human affections turn toward the father
who gave him mortal life. The atheism of to-day is but a
species of idolatry after all.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p><b>33. Sectarian View of the Godhead.</b>&mdash;The consistent,
simple, and authentic doctrine respecting the character and
attributes of God, such as was taught by Christ and the
apostles, gave way as revelation ceased, and as the darkness
incident to the absence of authority fell upon the world,
after the apostles and their priesthood had been driven
from the earth; and in its place there appeared numerous
theories and dogmas of men, many of which are utterly
incomprehensible in their mysticism and inconsistency. In
the year 325 A.D., the Council of Nice was convened by
the emperor Constantine, who sought through this body to
secure a declaration of Christian belief which would be
received as authoritative, and be the means of arresting the
increasing dissension incident to the general disagreement
regarding the nature of the Godhead, and other theological
subjects. The Council condemned some of the theories
then current; among them that of Arius, which asserted a
separate individuality for each member of the Trinity; and
promulgated a new code of belief known as the Nicene
Creed. A statement of this doctrine, supposedly as announced
by Athanasius, is as follows:&mdash;"We worship one God in
trinity, and trinity in unity; neither confounding the persons,
nor dividing the substance. For there is one person
of the Father, another of the Son, and another of the Holy
Ghost. But the Godhead of the Father, Son, and Holy
Ghost, is all one; the glory equal, the majesty co-eternal.
Such as the Father is, such is the Son, and such is the Holy
Ghost. The Father uncreate, the Son uncreate, and the Holy
Ghost uncreate. The Father incomprehensible, the Son
incomprehensible, and the Holy Ghost incomprehensible.
The Father eternal, the Son eternal, and the Holy Ghost
eternal. And yet there are not three eternals, but one
eternal. As also there are not three incomprehensibles,
nor three uncreated; but one uncreated, and one incomprehensible.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
So likewise the Father is almighty, the Son
almighty, and the Holy Ghost almighty, and yet there are
not three Almighties, but one Almighty. So the Father is
God, the Son is God, and the Holy Ghost is God, and yet
there are not three Gods, but one God." It would be difficult
to conceive of a greater number of inconsistencies and
contradictions, expressed in words as few.</p>

<p><b>34.</b> The Church of England teaches the present orthodox
view of God as follows:&mdash;"There is but one living and true
God, everlasting, without body, parts, or passions; of infinite
power, wisdom, and goodness." The immateriality of God
as asserted in these declarations of sectarian faith is entirely
at variance with the scriptures, and absolutely contradicted
by the revelations of God's person and attributes, as shown
by the citations already made.</p>

<p><b>35.</b> We affirm that to deny the materiality of God's person
is to deny God; for a thing without parts has no whole, and
an immaterial body cannot exist.<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> The Church of Jesus
Christ of Latter-day Saints proclaims against the incomprehensible
God, devoid of "body, parts, and passions," as a
thing impossible of existence, and asserts its belief in and
allegiance to the true and living God of scripture and
revelation.</p>

<h4>NOTES.</h4>

<p><b>1. Natural to Believe in a God.</b>&mdash;"The great and primary truth 'that there is a
God' has obtained among men almost universally and in all ages; so that the holy scriptures,
which speak of God in every page, and which advert to the sentiments of mankind
for the period of about four thousand years, always assume this truth as admitted. In the
early ages of the world, indeed, there is no positive evidence that speculative theism had
any advocates; and if, at a subsequent period, the 'fool said in his heart, There is no
God,' the sentiment appears more prominent in his affections than in his judgment; and,
withal, had so feeble an influence over the minds of men, that the sacred writers never
deemed it necessary to combat the error, either by formal arguments, or by an appeal to
miraculous operations. Polytheism, not atheism, was the prevailing sin; and therefore
the aim of inspired men was not so much to prove the existence of one God, as the non-existence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
of others,&mdash;to maintain His authority, to enforce His laws, to the exclusion of
all rival pretenders."...</p>

<p>"So clear, full, and overpowering is the evidence of God's existence, that it has commanded
general belief in all ages and countries,&mdash;the only exceptions being a few savage
tribes of a most degraded type, among whom the idea of God has faded and disappeared
with every vestige of civilization; and a few eccentric would-be philosophers who affect
to doubt everything which others believe, and question the truth of their own intuitions,
so that the general assent to the being of a God might be added as a testimony of no small
weight in this argument."&mdash;<cite>Cassell's Bible Dictionary; article "God."</cite></p>

<p><b>2. Importance of Belief in God.</b>&mdash;"The existence of a Supreme Being is, without
doubt, the sublimest conception that can enter the human mind, and, even as a
scientific question, can have no equal, for it assumes to furnish the cause of causes, the
great ultimate fact in philosophy, the last and sublimest generalization of scientific
truth. Yet this is the lowest demand it presents for our study; for it lies at the very
foundation of morality, virtue, and religion; it supports the social fabric, and gives
cohesion to all its parts; it involves the momentous question of man's immortality and
responsibility to supreme authority, and is inseparably connected with his brightest hopes
and highest enjoyments. It is, indeed, not only a fundamental truth, but the grand
central truth of all other truths. All other truths in science, ethics, and religion radiate
from this. It is the source from which they all flow, the center to which they all converge,
and the one sublime proposition to which they all bear witness. It has, therefore,
no parallel in its solemn grandeur and momentous issues."&mdash;<em>The same.</em></p>

<p><b>3. Belief in God, Natural and Necessary.</b>&mdash;Dr. Joseph Le Conte, Professor
of Geology and Natural History in the University of California, and a scientist of world-wide
renown, has spoken as follows:&mdash;"<em>Theism</em>, or a belief in God or in gods, or in a
supernatural agency of some kind, controlling the phenomena around us, is the fundamental
basis and condition of all religion, and is therefore universal, necessary, and intuitive.
I will not, therefore, attempt to bring forward any proof of that which lies back of all
proof, and is already more certain than anything can be made by any process of reasoning.
The ground of this belief lies in the very nature of man; it is the very foundation
and groundwork of reason. It is this and this only which gives significance to Nature;
without it, neither religion nor science, nor indeed human life, would be possible. For,
observe what is the characteristic of man in his relation to external Nature. To the brute,
the phenomena of Nature are nothing but sensuous phenomena; but man, just in proportion
as he uses his human faculties, instinctively ascends from the phenomena to their
cause. This is inevitable by a law of our nature, but the process of ascent is different for
the cultured and uncultured races. The uncultured man, when a phenomenon occurs, the
cause of which is not immediately perceived, passes by one step from the sensuous
phenomenon to the first cause; while the cultured, and especially the scientific man,
passes from the sensuous phenomena through a chain of secondary causes to the first
cause. The region of second causes, and this only, is the domain of science. Science
may, in fact, be defined, as the <em>study of the modes of operation of the first cause</em>. It is
evident, therefore, that the recognition of second causes cannot preclude the idea of the
existence of God.... Thus, Theism is necessary, intuitive, and therefore universal.
We cannot get rid of it if we would. Push it out, as many do, at the front door, and it
comes in again, perhaps unrecognized, at the back door. Turn it out in its <em>nobler forms</em>
as revealed in Scripture, and it comes in again in its <em>ignoble forms</em>, it may be as magnetism,
electricity, or gravity, or some other supposed efficient agent controlling Nature.
In some form, noble or ignoble, it will become a guest in the human heart. I therefore
repeat, <em>Theism neither requires nor admits of proof</em>. But in these latter times, there is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
a strong tendency for Theism to take the form of <em>Pantheism</em>, and thereby religious belief
is robbed of all its power over the human heart. It becomes necessary, therefore, for me
to attempt to show, not the existence indeed, but the <em>personality of Deity</em>....
Among a certain class of cultivated minds, and especially among scientific men, there is
a growing sentiment, sometimes openly expressed, sometimes only vaguely felt, that
what we call God is only a universal, all-pervading principle animating Nature,&mdash;a
general principle of evolution&mdash;an unconscious, impersonal life-force under which the
whole cosmos slowly develops. Now, this form of Theism may possibly satisfy the
demands of a purely speculative philosophy, but cannot satisfy the cravings of the human
heart.... The argument for the personality of Deity is derived from the evidences
of intelligent contrivance and design in Nature, or in the adjustment of parts for a definite,
and an intelligent purpose. It is usually called '<em>the argument from design</em>.' The force
of this argument is felt at once intuitively by all minds, and its effect is irresistible and
overwhelming to every plain, honest mind, unplagued by metaphysical subtleties."&mdash;Prof.
Joseph Le Conte: in <cite>Religion and Science</cite>, pp. 12-14.</p>

<p><b>4. God in Nature.</b>&mdash;Sir Isaac Newton, one of the most critical of scientific
workers, in writing to his friend Dr. Bentley in 1692, said in reference to the natural
universe: "To make such a system, with all its motions, required a Cause which understood
and compared together the quantities of matter in the several bodies of the sun
and planets, and the gravitating powers resulting from them, the several distances of
the primary planets from the sun, and of the secondary ones from Saturn, Jupiter, and
the earth; and the velocities with which these planets could revolve about those quantities
of matter in the central bodies; and to compare and adjust all these things together
in so great a variety of bodies argues the Cause to be not blind and fortuitous, but very
well skilled in mechanics and geometry."</p>

<p><b>5. Natural Indications of God's Existence.</b>&mdash;"It may not be, it is not
likely, that God can be found with microscope and scalpel, with
test-tube or flask, with
goniometer or telescope; but with such tools, the student earnestly working, cannot fail
to recognize a power beyond his vision, yet a power of which the pulses and the motions
are unmistakable. The extent of our solar system once seemed to man more limited
than it does at present; and the discovery of the most distant of the planetary family
was due to a recognition of an attractive force inexplicable except on the supposition of
the existence of another planet. The astronomer, tracing known bodies along their
orbital paths, could feel the pull, could see the wire that drew them from a narrower
course; he saw not Neptune as he piled calculations sheet on sheet; but the existence of
that orb was clearly indicated, and by heeding such indications he sought for it, and it
was found. Theory alone could never have revealed it, though theory was incomplete,
unsatisfactory without it; but the practical search, instigated by theory, led to the great
demonstration. And what is all science but theory compared to the practical influence
of prayerful reliance on the assistance of an omnipotent, omniscient power? Disregard
not the indications of your science work,&mdash;the trembling of the needle that reveals the
magnetic influence; the instinct within that speaks of a life and a Life-Giver, far beyond
human power of explanation or comprehension. As you sit beneath the canopied vault,
pondering in the silence of night over the perturbations, the yearnings which the soul
cannot ignore, turn in the direction indicated by those impulses, and with the penetrating,
space-annihilating, time-annulling glass of prayer and faith, seek the source of that
pervading force."&mdash;The Author in <cite>Baccalaureate Sermon</cite>, Utah University Quarterly,
Sept., 1895.</p>

<p><b>6. Theism; Atheism, etc.</b>&mdash;According to current usage, <em>Theism</em> signifies a belief
in God,&mdash;the acceptance of one living and eternal Being who has revealed Himself to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
man. <em>Deism</em> implies a professed belief in God, but denies to Deity the power to reveal
Himself, and asserts a disbelief in Christianity; the term is used in different senses,
prominent among which are:&mdash;(1) belief in God as an intelligent and eternal Being, with
a denial of all providential care: (2) belief in God, with denial of a future state of the
soul: (3) as advocated by Kant, denial of a personal God, while asserting belief in an
infinite force, inseparably associated with matter, and operating as the first great cause.
<em>Pantheism</em> regards matter and mind as one, embracing everything finite and infinite, and
calls this universal existence God. In its philosophical aspect, pantheism "has three
generic forms with variations: (1) <em>one-substance pantheism</em> which ascribes to the universal
being the attributes of both mind and matter, thought and extension, as in
Spinoza's system: (2) <em>materialistic pantheism</em> which ascribes to it only the attributes of
matter, as in the system of Strauss: (3) <em>idealistic pantheism</em> which ascribes to it only the
existence of mind as in Hegel's system." In its doctrinal aspect, pantheism comprises
"the worship of nature and humanity founded on the doctrine that the entire phenomenal
universe, including man and nature, is the ever-changing manifestation of God."
<em>Polytheism</em> is the doctrine of a plurality of gods, who are usually regarded as personifications
of forces or phenomena of nature. <em>Monotheism</em> is the doctrine that there is but
one God. <em>Atheism</em> signifies disbelief in God, or the denial of God's existence; <em>dogmatic
atheism</em> denies, while <em>negative atheism</em> ignores, the existence of a God. <em>Infidelity</em> is
sometimes used as synonymous with atheism, though specifically the term signifies a
milder form of unbelief, manifesting itself in scepticism on matters religious, a disbelief
in the religion of the Bible, and of course a rejection of the doctrines of Christianity.
<em>Agnosticism</em> holds that God is unknown and unknowable; that His existence can
neither be proved nor disproved; it neither affirms nor denies the existence of a personal
God; it is the doctrine of "We do not know."&mdash;<em>See Standard Dictionary.</em></p>

<p><b>7. Idolatrous Practices in General.</b>&mdash;The soul of man, once abandoned to
depravity, is strongly prone to depart from God and his institutions. "Hence," says
Burder, "have arisen the altars and demons of heathen antiquity, their extravagant
fictions, and abominable orgies. Hence we find among the Babylonians and Arabians,
the adoration of the heavenly bodies, the earliest forms of idolatry; among the Canaanites
and Syrians, the worship of Baal, Tammuz, Magog, and Astarte; among the
Ph&oelig;nicians, the immolation of children to Moloch; among the Egyptians, divine honors
bestowed on animals, birds, insects, leeks, and onions; among the Persians, religious
reverence offered to fire; and among the polished Greeks, the recognition in their system
of faith of thirty thousand gods. Hence, moreover, we find at the present time, among
most Pagan tribes, the deadliest superstitions, the most cruel and bloody rites, and the
most shocking licentiousness and vice, practiced under the name of religion."&mdash;<cite>History
of all Religions</cite>, p. 12.</p>

<p><b>8. Examples of Atrocious Idolatry.</b>&mdash;The worship of Moloch is generally
cited as an example of the cruelest and most abhorrent idolatry known to man. Moloch,
called also Molech, Malcham, Milcom, Baal-melech, etc., was an Ammonite idol: it is
mentioned in scripture in connection with its cruel rites (Lev. xviii, 21; xx, 2-5; see also
I Kings xi, 5, 7, 33; II Kings xxiii, 10, 13; Amos v, 26; Zephaniah i, 5; Jeremiah
xxxii, 35). Keil and Delitzsch describe the idol as being "represented by a brazen statue
which was hollow, and capable of being heated, and formed with a bull's head, and with
arms stretched out to receive the children to be sacrificed." While the worship of this
idol did not invariably include human sacrifice, it is certain that such hideous rites were
characteristic of this abominable shrine. The authors last quoted say: "From the time
of Ahaz, children were slain at Jerusalem in the valley of
Ben-Hinnom, and then sacrificed
by being laid in the heated arms and burned." (II Kings xxiii, 10; xvi, 3; xvii, 17;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
xxi, 6; Jer. xxxii, 35; Ezek. xvi, 20, 21; xx, 31; compare Psalms cvi, 37, 38.) Many
authorities state that the sacrifice of children to this hideous monster long ante-dated the
time of Ahaz. "The offering of living victims was probably the climax of enormity in
connection with this system, and it is said that Tophet, where it was to be witnessed,
was so named from the beating of drums to drown the shrieks and groans of those who
were burned to death. The same place was called the Valley of Hinnom, and the horrible
associations connected with it led to both Tophet and Gehenna ('valley of Hinnom')
being adopted as names and symbols of future torment." For foregoing facts,
and others, <em>see "The Pentateuch" by Keil and Delitzsch, and Cassell's Bible Dictionary</em>.</p>

<p>Scarcely less horrible were the practices of voluntary suicide under the car of the idol
Juggernaut, and the drowning of children in the sacred Ganges as found among the Hindoos.
According to Burder ("History of all Religions"), the ponderous and hideous
image Juggernaut, was, on festival days, usually placed on a movable tower resting on
wheels; and, thus mounted, was drawn through the streets by enthusiastic worshipers.
As the car moved along, some of the most zealous of the devotees threw themselves
under the wheels and were crushed to death; and such acts were "hailed with the acclamations
of the multitude as the most acceptable sacrifices." The same author thus describes
the rite of child-sacrifice to the sacred river, as formerly practiced in India:&mdash;"People
in some parts of India, particularly the inhabitants of Orissa, and of the eastern
parts of Bengal, frequently offer their children to the goddess Gunga. The following
reason is assigned for this practice: When a woman has been long married, and has no
children, it is common for the man, or his wife, or both of them, to make a vow to the
goddess Gunga, that if she will bestow the blessing of children upon them, they will
devote the firstborn to her. If, after this vow, they have children, the eldest is nourished
till a proper age, which may be three, four, or more years, according to circumstances
when, on a particular day, appointed for bathing in any part of the river, they take the
child with them and offer it to the goddess: the child is encouraged to go farther and
farther into the water, till it is carried away by the stream, or is pushed off by its inhuman
parents."&mdash;<cite>History of all Religions</cite>, pp. 745-746.</p>

<p>The practices of Druidism among the ancient Britons furnish another example of
degradation in religion through the absence of authoritative guidance and the light of
revelation. The Druids professed a veneration for the oak, and performed most of their
distinctive ceremonies in sacred groves. Human sacrifices were offered as a feature of
their system. Of their temples, some, e.g. Stonehenge on Salisbury Plain, Wiltshire, and
others in Kent, still remain. These circular enclosures, which were open to the sky,
were called <em>doom-rings</em>: near the center of each was an altar (<em>dolmen</em>) on which victims
were sacrificed. The horrible ceremonies included on special occasions the burning alive
of large numbers of human beings, enclosed in immense cages of
wicker-work.</p>

<p><b>9. Immaterialists are Atheists.</b>&mdash;"There are two classes of atheists in the
world. One class denies the existence of God in the most positive language; the other
denies his existence in duration or space. One says 'There is no God;' the other says
'God is not <em>here</em> or <em>there</em>, any more than he exists <em>now</em> and <em>then</em>.' The infidel says 'God
does not exist anywhere.' The immaterialist says 'He exists <em>nowhere</em>.' The infidel
says 'There is no such substance as God.' The immaterialist says 'There is such a
substance as God, but it is <em>without parts</em>.' The atheist says 'There is no such substance
as <em>spirit</em>.' The immaterialist says 'A spirit, though he lives and acts, occupies no room,
and fills no space in the same way and in the same manner as matter, not even so much
as does the minutest grain of sand.' The atheist does not seek to hide his infidelity; but
the immaterialist, whose declared belief amounts to the same thing as the atheist's,
endeavors to hide his infidelity under the shallow covering of a few words.... The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
immaterialist is a religious atheist; he only differs from the other class of atheists by
clothing an indivisible unextended <em>nothing</em> with the powers of a God. One class believes
in no God; the other believes that <em>Nothing</em> is god and worships it as such."&mdash;Orson
Pratt, in pamphlet <cite>Absurdities of Immaterialism</cite>, p. 11.</p>

<p><b>10. Atheism, a Fatal Belief.</b>&mdash;"During the Reign of Terror, the French were
declared by the National Assembly to be a nation of atheists; but a brief experience convinced
them that a nation of atheists could not long exist. Robespierre then 'proclaimed
in the convention, that belief in the existence of God was necessary to those principles
of virtue and morality upon which the republic was founded; and on the 7th of
May, the national representatives, who had so lately prostrated themselves before the
Goddess of Reason, voted by acclamation that the French people acknowledged the existence
of the Supreme Being, and the immortality of the soul.'"&mdash;<cite>Students' France, xxvii,
6</cite>; quoted by Rev. Charles E. Little, in <cite>Historical Lights</cite>, pp.
280-281.</p>

<p><b>11. The Trinity.</b>&mdash;"'Mormonism' affirms its unqualified belief in the Godhead as
the Holy Trinity, comprising Father, Son, and Holy Ghost; each of the three a separate
and individual personage; the Father and the Son each a personage of spirit and of immortalized
body; the Holy Ghost a personage of spirit. The unity of the Godhead is
accepted in the literal fulness of scriptural declaration&mdash;that the Three are one in purpose,
plan, and method; alike in all their Godly attributes; one in their Divine omniscience
and omnipotence; yet as separate and distinct in their personality as are any
three inhabitants of earth. 'Mormonism' claims that scripture passages declaring the
oneness of the Trinity admit of this interpretation; that such indeed is the natural
interpretation, and that the conception is in accord with reason."&mdash;<cite>The Philosophy of
"Mormonism</cite>," by The Author: Improvement Era, vol. iv, p. 463.</p>

<p><b>12. The Father and the Son.</b>&mdash;In the treatment of the "Personality of
Each Member of the Godhead" (p. 41) and "Divine Attributes" (p. 42) no
attempt has been made to segregate the references made to The Father and to The
Son. It is to be remembered that the Personage most generally designated in
the Old Testament as God or the LORD, is He who in the mortal state was
known as Jesus Christ, and in the antemortal state as Jehovah. See the author's
work, "Jesus the Christ," chap. iv. That Jesus Christ or Jehovah is designated
in certain scriptures as the Father in no wise justifies an assumption of
identity between Him and His Father, Elohim. This matter has been explained
in a publication dated June 30, 1916, entitled "The Father and The Son; a
Doctrinal Exposition by the First Presidency and the Twelve." This appeared in
<cite>Improvement Era</cite>, August, 1916, and in a pamphlet of earlier issue. Excerpts therefrom
follow: "The term 'Father' as applied to Deity occurs in sacred writ
with plainly different meanings. Each of the four significations specified in the
following treatment should be carefully segregated.</p>

<p>"1. <em>'Father' as Literal Parent.</em>... Jesus Christ is the Son of Elohim both
as spiritual and bodily offspring; that is to say, Elohim is literally the Father of
the spirit of Jesus Christ and also of the body in which Jesus Christ performed
His mission in the flesh....</p>

<p>"2. <em>'Father' as Creator.</em> A second scriptural meaning of 'Father' is that of
Creator, e.g. in passages referring to any one of the Godhead as 'The Father of
the heavens and of the earth.'... With this meaning, as the context
shows in every case, Jehovah, who is Jesus Christ the Son of Elohim, is called
'the Father.'...</p>

<p>"3. <em>Jesus Christ the 'Father' of those who abide in His Gospel".</em> See Doc. and Cov.
xxxiv, 1-3; xxxv, 1, 2; xxxix, 1-4; Mosiah xv, 10-13.</p>

<p>"4. <em>Jesus Christ the 'Father' by Divine Investiture of Authority".</em> See John x. 30;
xvii, 11, 22; compare xiv. 28; see further v, 43; x, 26; III Nephi xx, 35; xxviii,
10; and Doc. and Cov. 1, 43.</p></blockquote>

Adam's transgression.</p></blockquote>


<p class="center">TRANSGRESSION AND ITS RESULTS.</p>

<p><b>1. Man's Free Agency.</b>&mdash;The Church holds and teaches
as a strictly scriptural doctrine, that man has inherited
among the inalienable rights conferred upon him by his
divine Father, absolute freedom to choose the good or the
evil in life as he may elect. This right cannot be guarded
with more jealous care than is bestowed upon it by God
Himself; for in all His dealings with man, He has left the
mortal creature free to choose and to act, with no semblance
of compulsion or restraint, beyond the influences of paternal
counsel and loving direction.<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> True, He has given commandments,
and has established statutes, with promises of blessings
for compliance and dire penalties for infraction; but
in the choice of these, God's children are untrammeled. In
this respect, man is no less free than are the angels and the
Gods, except as he has fettered himself with the bonds of
sin, and forfeited his power of will and force of soul. The
individual has as full a measure of liberty to violate the
laws of health, the requirements of nature, and the commandments
of God in matters both temporal and spiritual,
as he has to obey all such; in the one case he brings upon
himself the sure penalties that belong to the broken law;
as in the other he inherits the specific blessings and the
added freedom that attend a law-abiding life. Obedience
to law is the habit of the free man; 'tis the transgressor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
who fears the law, for he brings upon himself deprivation
and restraint, not because of the law, which would have
protected him in his freedom, but because of his antagonism
to law.</p>

<p><b>2.</b> The predominant attribute of justice, recognized as part
of the Divine nature, forbids the thought that man should
receive promises of reward for righteousness, and threats of
punishment for evil deeds, if he possessed no power of independent
action. It is no more a part of God's plan to compel
men to work righteousness, than it is His purpose to
permit evil powers to force His children into sin. In the
days of Eden, the first man had placed before him commandment
and law,<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> with an explanation of the penalty which
would follow a violation of that law. No law could have
been given him in righteousness had he not been free to act
for himself. "Nevertheless thou mayest choose for thyself,
for it is given unto thee, but remember that I forbid it,"<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a>
said the Lord God to Adam. Concerning His dealings with
the first patriarch of the race, God has declared in this day,
"Behold, I gave unto him that he should be an agent unto
himself."<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a></p>

<p><b>3.</b> When the brothers Cain and Abel brought their sacrifices
before the Lord, the elder one became angry because his
offering was rejected; then the Lord reasoned with Cain, and
endeavored to teach him that he must expect results of his
actions to follow in kind, good or evil, as he might elect:&mdash;"If
thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted? and if thou doest
not well, sin lieth at the door."<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a></p>

<p><b>4.</b> A knowledge of good and evil is essential to the advancement
which God has made possible for His children to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
achieve; this knowledge can be best gained by actual experience,
with the contrasts of good and its opposite before the
eyes; therefore has man been placed upon the earth subject
to the influence of good and wicked powers, with a knowledge
of the conditions surrounding him, and the heaven-born
right to choose for himself. The words of the prophet, Lehi,
are particularly explicit: "Wherefore, the Lord God gave
unto man that he should act for himself. Wherefore, man
could not act for himself, save it should be that he was enticed
by the one or the other.... Wherefore, men are free
according to the flesh; and all things are given them which
are expedient unto man. And they are free to choose liberty
and eternal life, through the great mediation of all men, or
to choose captivity and death, according to the captivity and
power of the devil; for he seeketh that all men might be
miserable like unto himself."<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a></p>

<p><b>5.</b> Alma, another Nephite prophet, in speaking of those
who had died, said they had gone "that they might reap their
rewards, according to their works, whether they were good or
whether they were bad, to reap eternal happiness or eternal
misery, according to the spirit which they listed to obey,
whether it be a good spirit or a bad one; For every man
receiveth wages of him whom he listeth to obey, and this
according to the words of the spirit of prophecy."<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a></p>

<p><b>6.</b> Samuel, the converted Lamanite, upon whom the spirit
of the prophets had fallen, admonished his wayward fellows
in this wise: "And now remember, remember my brethren,
that whosoever perisheth, perisheth unto himself; and whosoever
doeth iniquity, doeth it unto himself; for behold, ye
are free; ye are permitted to act for yourselves; for behold,
God hath given unto you a knowledge, and He hath made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
you free; He hath given unto you that ye might know good
from evil, and He hath given unto you that ye might choose
life or death."<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a></p>

<p><b>7.</b> When the plans for creating and peopling the earth
were under discussion in heaven, Satan sought to destroy
the free agency of man, by obtaining power to force the
human family to do his will, promising the Father that by
such means he would redeem all mankind, and that not one
of them should be lost.<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> This proposition was rejected, while
the original purpose of the Father,&mdash;to use persuasive influences
of wholesome precept and sacrificing example with the
inhabitants of the earth, then to leave them free to choose
for themselves, was agreed upon, and the Only Begotten Son
was chosen as the chief instrument in carrying that purpose
into effect.</p>

<p><b>8. Man's Responsibility</b> for his individual acts is as complete
as is his agency to elect for himself. The natural result
of good deeds is happiness; the consequence of evil is misery;
these follow in every man's life by inviolable laws. There is
a plan of judgment<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> divinely fore-ordained, by which every
man will be called to answer for his deeds; and not for deeds
alone but for his words also, and even for the thoughts of his
heart. "But I say unto you, that every idle word that men
shall speak, they shall give account thereof in the day of
judgment."<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> These are the words of the Savior Himself.
"And let none of you imagine evil in your hearts against his
neighbor, and love no false oath: for all these are things that
I hate, saith the Lord."<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> John the Revelator was permitted

last judgment; he says: "And I saw the dead, small and
great, stand before God; and the books were opened: and
another book was opened, which is the book of life; and the
dead were judged out of those things which were written in
the books, according to their works. And the sea gave up
the dead which were in it; and death and hell delivered up
the dead which were in them: and they were judged every
man according to their works."<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a></p>

<p><b>9.</b> The judgment of God is not always made to follow immediately
the acts of men; good deeds may not be at once
rewarded, evil is rarely peremptorily punished; and this is
according to Divine wisdom; were it appointed otherwise,
the test of individual nature, and the trial of human faith,
for which purposes this mortal probation was primarily ordained,
would be greatly lessened; for the certainty of immediate
pleasure or pain would almost universally determine
human acts to secure the one and to avoid the other. Judgment,
therefore, is postponed, that every one may fully prove
his nature, the good man increasing in righteousness, and the
evil doer possessing opportunity of repentance and reparation
before the great and terrible day. On rare occasions, speedy
judgment of a temporal nature has been executed, the physical
results of worldly blessing for good,<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> and calamity for evil
deeds<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133a]</a> following swiftly upon the acts. Whether such retribution
entirely satisfies the claims of justice, or a further
visitation of judgment is to take place beyond this world,
matters not. Such acts are exceptional in the Divine administration.</p>

<p><b>10.</b> It is the prerogative of Jesus Christ<a name="FNanchor_a_a" id="FNanchor_a_a"></a><a href="#Footnote_a_a" class="fnanchor">[133b]</a> to judge the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
children of men, and He will do it as His own purposes,
which are likewise the purposes of His Father, may be best
served. John records the words of Christ: "For the Father
judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment unto
the Son; that all men should honor the Son even as they
honor the Father."<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> And Peter, while expounding the
gospel to the devout Gentile, Cornelius, declared concerning
Jesus Christ, that "it is He which was ordained of God to
be the Judge of quick and dead."<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> Of the dread fate of
the wicked reserved for the judgment day, many prophets
have borne record<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> and the presiding Judge of that awful
tribunal has given in His own words descriptions<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> so vivid
and forceful, as to leave no shadow of doubt that every
living soul will be called to acknowledge the record, and to
accept the results of his acts. The Lord's words and those
of His prophets are unequivocal, that He is no respecter
of persons,<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> and that any species of favor foreign to justice
is unknown to Him. This judgment none but the unrepentant
wicked need fear; to the righteous it is a time of
triumph.<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a></p>

<p><b>11. Sin.</b>&mdash;What is the nature of sin? To this question
the Apostle John replies, "Sin is the transgression of the
law."<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> In the original language of the Bible records, many
words occur for which our single term sin is used, all however
conveying the common idea of opposition to the Divine
will.<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> As God is the embodiment of purity and perfection,
such opposition is a rebellion against the principles of advancement,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
and an acceptance of the practices that lead to
degradation. Sin is any condition, whether consisting in
omission of things required, or in commission of acts forbidden,
which tends to prevent or hinder the development
of the human soul. As a righteous course leads to eternal
life, so sin tends toward the darkness of the second death.
Sin was introduced to the world by the arch-fiend Satan;<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a>
yet it is by Divine permission that mankind is brought in
contact with sin, the contrast between evil and good thus
being learned.</p>

<p><b>12.</b> According to the technical definition of sin, it consists
in the violation of law, and in this strict sense sin may
be committed inadvertently or in ignorance. It is plain,
however, from the scriptural doctrine of human responsibility,
and the unerring justice of God, that in his transgressions
as in his righteous deeds, man will be judged according
to his ability to comprehend law. To him who has
never been made acquainted with a higher law, the requirements
of that law do not apply in their fulness. For sins
committed without knowledge,&mdash;that is, for laws violated in
ignorance, a propitiation has been provided in the atonement
wrought through the sacrifice of the Savior; and sinners
of this class do not stand condemned.</p>

<p><b>13.</b> Nephi, prophesying to the ancient inhabitants of the
western continent, taught them this doctrine:&mdash;"Where
there is no law given, there is no punishment; and where
there is no punishment, there is no condemnation; and
where there is no condemnation, the mercies of the Holy
One of Israel have claim upon them, because of the atonement;
for they are delivered by the power of him; For the
atonement satisfieth the demands of his justice upon all
those who have not the law given to them, that they are
delivered from that awful monster, death and hell and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
devil, and the lake of fire and brimstone which is endless
torment; and they are restored to that God who gave them
breath, which is the Holy One of Israel."<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> And then, in
contrast with the lot of those who are thus pardonable, the
prophet adds:&mdash;"But wo unto him that has the law given;
yea, that has all the commandments of God, like unto us,
and that transgresseth them, and that wasteth the days of
his probation, for awful is his state!"<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> This is in strict
agreement with the teachings of Paul to the Romans, "For
as many as have sinned without law shall also perish without
law; and as many as have sinned in the law shall be
judged by the law."<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> And the word of modern scripture is
to the same effect, for we are told through recent revelation
to the Church, that among those who are to receive the
blessings of redemption are "they who died without law."<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a>
These will include the heathen nations, whose redemption is
promised, with the added declaration that "they that knew
no law shall have part in the first resurrection."<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a></p>

<p><b>14. Punishment for Sin.&mdash;</b>As rewards for righteous deeds
are proportionate to deserving acts, so the punishment
prescribed for sin is made adequate to the offence.<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> Punishment
is inflicted upon the sinner, for disciplinary and
reformatory purposes, and in support of justice. There is
nothing of vindictiveness or of desire to cause suffering in
the Divine nature; on the contrary, our Father is cognizant
of every pang, and permits such to afflict for beneficent
purposes only. God's mercy is declared in the retributive
pains which He allows, as in the blessings of peace which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
issue from His hand. It is scarcely profitable to speculate
as to the exact nature of the spiritual suffering imposed as
punishment for sin. Comparison with physical pain,<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> such
as the tortures of fire, in a sulphurous lake, serve to show
that the human mind is incapable of comprehending the
depth of these dread penalties. The sufferings entailed by
the awful fate of condemnation are more to be feared than
are any possible inflictions of purely physical torture; the
mind, the spirit, the whole soul is doomed to suffer, and
the extent of the torment no man knoweth.</p>

<p><b>15.</b> Consider the word of the Lord regarding those
whose sin is the unpardonable one, whose transgression has
carried them beyond the present horizon of possible redemption;
those who have sunk so low in their wickedness
as to have lost the power and even the desire to attempt
reformation.<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> "Sons of Perdition" is the terrible designation
by which they are known. These are they who, having
learned the power of God, afterward renounce it; those who
sin wilfully, in the light of knowledge; those who open
their hearts to the Holy Spirit, and then put the Lord to a
mockery and a shame by denying Him; and those who
commit murder, wherein they shed innocent blood;<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> these
are they of whom the Savior has declared that it would be
better for them had they never been born.<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> These are to
share the punishment of the devil and his angels&mdash;punishment
so terrible that the knowledge is withheld from all
except those who are consigned to this dread doom, though
a momentary glance at the awful picture is permitted to
some.<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> These sinners are the only ones over whom the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
second death hath power, "Yea, verily, the only ones who
shall not be redeemed in the due time of the Lord."<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a></p>

<p><b>16. The Duration of Punishment.</b>&mdash;As to the duration of
such punishment, we may take assurance that it will be
graded according to the sin; and that the popular interpretation
of scriptural passages to the effect that every
sentence for misdeeds is interminable, is entirely false.<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a>
Great as is the effect of this life upon the hereafter, and
terrible as is the responsibility of opportunities lost for
repentance, God holds the power to pardon beyond the
grave. And yet the scriptures speak of eternal and endless
punishment. Any punishment ordained of God is eternal,
for He is eternal.<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a> His is a system of endless punishment,
for it will always exist as a place or condition prepared
for disobedient spirits; yet the infliction of the penalty
will have an end in every case of willing repentance and
attempted reparation. And repentance is not impossible
in the spirit world.<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> Yet, as seen, there are some sins so
terrible that their consequent punishments are not made
known to man;<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> these extreme penalties are reserved for
the "Sons of Perdition."</p>

<p><b>17.</b> The false doctrine that the punishment to be visited
upon the erring souls is endless, that every sentence for sin
is of interminable duration, must be regarded as one of the
most pernicious results of unenlightened sectarianism. It
is but a dogma of unauthorized and erring churches, at once
unscriptural, unreasonable, and revolting to one who loves
mercy and honors justice. True, the scriptures speak of
everlasting burnings, eternal damnation, and the vengeance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
of eternal fire,<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> as characteristics of the judgment provided
for the wicked; yet in no instance is there justification for
the inference that the individual sinner will have to suffer
the wrath of offended justice forever and ever. The punishment
in any case is sufficiently severe without the added
and supreme horror of unending continuation. Justice
must have her due; but when "the uttermost farthing" is
paid, the prison doors shall open and the captive be free.
But the prison remains, and the law prescribing punishment
for offences will not be repealed.</p>

<p><b>18.</b> So general were the ill-effects of the commonly-accepted
doctrine, unscriptural and untrue though it was,
regarding the endless torment awaiting every sinner, that
even before the Church had been formally organized in the
present dispensation, God gave a revelation through the
Prophet Joseph Smith, touching this matter, in which we
read:&mdash;"And surely every man must repent or suffer; for I,
God, am endless: wherefore I revoke not the judgments
which I shall pass, but woes shall go forth, weeping, wailing
and gnashing of teeth, yea to those who are found on
my left hand; nevertheless it is not written that there shall
be no end to this torment, but it is written endless torment.
Again it is written eternal damnation ... for
behold, I am endless, and the punishment which is given
from my hand, is endless punishment, for Endless is my
name; wherefore, eternal punishment is God's punishment.
Endless punishment is God's punishment.<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a>"</p>

<p><b>19. Satan.</b>&mdash;We have had occasion to refer frequently to
the author of evil among men. This is Satan,<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> the adversary
or opponent of the Lord, the chief of all evil spirits, called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
also the Devil,<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> Beelzebub,<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> or the Prince of Devils, Perdition,<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a>
and Belial.<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a> The figurative appellations Dragon and Serpent
are applied to Satan, when reference is made to his fall.<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a>
We learn from the revealed word<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a> that Satan was once an
angel of light; he was then known as Lucifer, a Son of the
Morning, but his uncontrolled ambition prompted him to
aspire to the glory and power of the Father, to secure which
he made the unjust proposition to redeem the human family
by compulsion; failing in this purpose, he headed an open
rebellion against the Father and the Son, drawing a third of
the hosts of heaven into his impious league.<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> These rebellious
spirits were expelled from heaven, and have since followed
the impulses of their wicked natures by seeking to lead
human souls to their own condition of darkness. They are
the Devil and his angels. The right of free agency, maintained
and vindicated by the fateful strife in heaven, prevents
the possibility of compulsion being employed in this fiendish
work of degradation; but the powers of these malignant
spirits to tempt and persuade are used to their utmost limits.
Satan tempted Eve to transgress the law of God;<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a> it was he
who imparted the secret of murder to the fratricide, Cain.<a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a></p>

<p><b>20.</b> Satan exerts a mastery over the spirits that have
been corrupted by his practices; he is the foremost of the
angels who were thrust down, and the instigator of the ruin
of those who fall in this life; he seeks to molest and hinder
mankind in good efforts, by tempting to sin; it may be by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
imposing sickness,<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a> or possibly death. Yet in all these
malignant doings, he can go no farther than the transgressions
of the victim may enable him, or the wisdom of God may
permit him to go, and he may at any time be checked by the
superior power. Indeed, even the operations of his utmost
malice may be turned to the accomplishment of Divine purposes.
The scriptures prove to us that the days of Satan's
power are already numbered,<a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a> his doom has been pronounced,
and in the Lord's own time he will be completely
overcome. He is to be bound during the millennial reign,<a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a>
and after that thousand years of blessed peace, he will be
loosed for a little season; then his defeat will be made complete,
and his power over the children of God will be
entirely destroyed.</p>


<p class="center">THE FALL.</p>

<p><b>21. Our First Parents in Eden.</b><a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a>&mdash;The crowning scene of
the great drama of creation was the forming of man in the
image of his spiritual Father, God.<a name="FNanchor_175_175" id="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a> For the reception of
the first man, the Creator had specially prepared a choice
region of earth, and had embellished it with natural
beauties calculated to gladden the heart of its royal
possessor. "The Lord God planted a garden eastward in
Eden,<a name="FNanchor_176_176" id="FNanchor_176_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a> and there he put the man whom he had formed."<a name="FNanchor_177_177" id="FNanchor_177_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a>
Soon after man's advent upon the earth the Lord created
for him a companion or help-meet, declaring that it was
not good that man should be alone,<a name="FNanchor_178_178" id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a> Thus, male and
female, Adam and his wife Eve, were placed in the Garden.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
They had been given dominion "over the fish of the sea, and
over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that
moveth upon the earth."<a name="FNanchor_179_179" id="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a> With this great power were
associated certain special commands, the first of which in
point of importance was that they "be fruitful and
multiply and replenish the earth, and subdue it;" then, that
they refrain from eating or even touching the fruit of a
certain tree, the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil,
which grew in the midst of the Garden, though of all other
fruits they were permitted to freely partake. The words of
God concerning this command and its penalty are:&mdash;"And
I, the Lord God, commanded the man, saying, of every
tree in the garden thou mayest freely eat, but of the tree of
the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it;
nevertheless thou mayest choose for thyself, for it is given
unto thee, but remember that I forbid it, for in the day thou
eatest thereof thou shalt surely die."<a name="FNanchor_180_180" id="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a></p>

<p><b>22. The Temptation</b> to disobey this command soon came.
Satan presented himself before Eve in the Garden, and,
speaking by the mouth of the serpent, questioned her about
the commands which God had given respecting the Tree of
Knowledge of Good and Evil. Eve answered that they
were forbidden even to touch the fruit of that tree, under
penalty of death. Satan then sought to beguile the woman,
contradicting the Lord's statement, and declaring that death
would not follow a violation of the Divine injunction; but
that, on the other hand, by doing that which the Lord had
forbidden, she and her husband would become like unto
the gods, knowing good and evil for themselves. The
woman was captivated by these representations; and, being
eager to possess the advantages pictured by Satan, she disobeyed
the command of the Lord, and partook of the fruit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
forbidden. She feared not evil, for she knew it not. Then,
telling Adam what she had done, she urged him to do likewise.</p>

<p><b>23.</b> Adam found himself in a position that impelled
him to disobey one of the requirements of God. He and
his wife had been commanded to multiply and replenish the
earth. Adam was still immortal; Eve had come under the
penalty of mortality; and in such dissimilar conditions, the
two could not remain together, and therefore could not fulfill
the Divine requirement. On the other hand, Adam
would be disobeying another command by yielding to his
wife's request. He deliberately and wisely decided to stand
by the first and greater commandment; and, therefore, with
a full comprehension of the nature of his act, he also partook
of the fruit that grew on the Tree of Knowledge. The
fact that Adam acted understandingly in this matter is
affirmed by the scriptures. Paul, in writing to Timothy,
explained that "Adam was not deceived; but the woman,
being deceived, was in the transgression."<a name="FNanchor_181_181" id="FNanchor_181_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a> The prophet
Lehi, in expounding the scriptures to his sons, declared
"Adam fell that man might be, and men are that they
might have joy."<a name="FNanchor_182_182" id="FNanchor_182_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a></p>

<p><b>24. The Tree of Life.</b>&mdash;There was another tree of special
virtues in Eden; its fruit insured life to all who ate of it.
While Adam and Eve lived in innocent immortality, this tree
had not been forbidden them; the celestial fruit indeed was
fitting food for their sinless state. Now that they had
transgressed, however, now that the Divine decree had
issued, fixing death as their lot, it was not proper that the
fruit of the Tree of Life should be longer within their reach.
They were, therefore, expelled from the Garden, and cherubim
with a flaming sword guarded the way, that man might not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
return in an unregenerate state. By the act of transgression,
our first parents acquired a knowledge, which in their
condition of pristine innocence they had not possessed,&mdash;the
experimental knowledge of good and evil. The result of
the Fall could have been of none but ill effect had the fallen
ones been immediately restored to a condition of immortality,
without repentance, without atonement. In the despair
that followed their realization of the great change that had
come upon them, and in the light of the knowledge gained
at such cost as to the virtues of the fruit that grew on the
Tree of Life, it would have been but natural for them to
seek the seeming advantages of an immediate escape, by partaking
of the celestial food. It was in mercy that they
were deprived of the means of so doing.</p>

<p><b>25.</b> The words of the Creator are unmistakable as to the
necessity of banishing His first earthly children from Eden:&mdash;"And
the Lord God said, Behold, the man is become as
one of us, to know good and evil: and now, lest he put forth
his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and
live forever: Therefore the Lord God sent him forth from
the garden of Eden, to till the ground from whence he was
taken. So he drove out the man: and he placed at the
east of the garden of Eden cherubim, and a flaming sword
which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of
life."<a name="FNanchor_183_183" id="FNanchor_183_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a></p>

<p><b>26.</b> Alma, the Nephite prophet, comprehended the result
that would have followed had Adam and his wife eaten of
the Tree of Life; he thus explained the matter:&mdash;"Now we
see that the man had become as God, knowing good and
evil; and lest he should put forth his hand, and take also
of the tree of life, and eat and live forever, the Lord God
placed Cherubim and the flaming sword, that he should not
partake of the fruit; And thus we see, that there was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
time granted unto man to repent, yea, a probationary time,
a time to repent and serve God. For behold, if Adam had
put forth his hand immediately, and partook of the tree of
life, he would have lived forever, according to the word of
God, having no space for repentance; yea, and also the
word of God would have been void, and the great plan of
salvation would have been frustrated."<a name="FNanchor_184_184" id="FNanchor_184_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a></p>

<p><b>27. The Immediate Result of the Fall</b> was the substitution
of mortality, with all its attendant frailties, for the
vigor of the primeval deathless state. Adam felt directly
the effects of transgression, in finding a barren and dreary
earth, with a sterile soil, instead of the beauty and fruitfulness
of Eden. In place of pleasing and useful plants,
thorns and thistles sprang up; and he had to labor arduously
under the conditions of physical fatigue and suffering, to
cultivate the soil that he might obtain necessary food.
Upon Eve fell the penalty of bodily infirmity; the pains and
sorrows, which since have been regarded as the natural lot of
womankind, came upon her, and she was made subject to
her husband. Having now lost their sense of former innocence,
they became ashamed of their nakedness, and the
Lord made for them garments of skins. And upon both the
man and the woman was visited the penalty of spiritual
death; for in that very day they were banished from Eden,
and cast out from the presence of the Lord. The serpent,
having served the purposes of Satan, was made a subject of
Divine displeasure, being doomed to crawl forever in the
dust, and to suffer from the enmity which it was decreed
should be placed in the hearts of Eve's children.<a name="FNanchor_185_185" id="FNanchor_185_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a></p>

<p><b>28. Atonement was Provided for.</b>&mdash;God left not His now
mortal children without hope. He gave other commandments
to Adam, requiring him to offer sacrifices in the name<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
of the Only Begotten Son, and promising redemption unto
him and all his descendants who would comply with the conditions
prescribed. The opportunity of winning the victor's
reward by overcoming evil was explained to our parents, and
they rejoiced. Adam said, "Blessed be the name of God, for
because of my transgression my eyes are opened, and in this
life I shall have joy, and again in the flesh I shall see God."
Eve was glad and declared, "Were it not for our transgression
we never should have had seed, and never should
have known good and evil, and the joy of our redemption,
and the eternal life which God giveth unto all the obedient."<a name="FNanchor_186_186" id="FNanchor_186_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a></p>

<p><b>29. The Fall came not by Chance.</b>&mdash;It would be unreasonable
to suppose that the transgression of Eve and Adam
came as a surprise to the Creator. By His infinite fore-knowledge,
God knew what would be the result of Satan's
temptation to Eve, and what Adam would do under the
conditions. And further, it is evident that the Fall was foreseen,
to be a means whereby man could be brought face to
face with both good and evil; that of his own agency he
might elect the one or the other, and thus be prepared by
the experiences of a mortal probation for the exaltation provided
in the glorious plan of his creation:&mdash;"For behold,
this is my work and my glory, to bring to pass the immortality
and eternal life of man;"<a name="FNanchor_187_187" id="FNanchor_187_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a> thus spake the Lord unto
Moses. It was the purpose of God to place within the reach
of the spirits begotten by Him in the heavens the means
of individual effort, and the opportunity of winning, not
merely redemption from death but also salvation and even
exaltation, with the powers of eternal progression and increase.
Hence, it was necessary that the spiritual offspring
of God should leave the mansions of their primeval childhood,
and enter the school of mortal experience, meeting,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
contending with, and overcoming evil, according to their
several degrees of faith and strength. Adam and Eve
could never have been the parents of a mortal posterity had
they not themselves become mortal; mortality, as before
stated, was an essential element in the Divine plan respecting
the earth and its appointed inhabitants; and as a means
of introducing mortality the Lord placed before the progenitors
of the race a law, knowing full well that transgression
would follow.</p>

<p><b>30.</b> Eve was fulfilling the foreseen purposes of God
by the part she took in the great drama of the Fall; yet
she did not partake of the forbidden fruit with that object
in view, but with the intent to violate the Divine command,
being deceived by the sophistries of the serpent-fiend.
Satan also, for that matter, furthered the purposes of the
Creator, in tempting Eve; yet his design was to thwart the
Lord's plan. We are definitely told that "he knew not the
mind of God, wherefore he sought to destroy the world."<a name="FNanchor_188_188" id="FNanchor_188_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a>
Yet, his diabolical effort, far from being the initiatory step
toward destruction, contributed to the plan of man's eternal
exaltation. Adam's part in the great event was essentially
different from that of his wife; he was not deceived; on the
contrary he deliberately decided to do as Eve desired, that
he might carry out the purposes of his Maker with respect
to the race of men, whose first patriarch he was ordained
to be.</p>

<p><b>31.</b> Even the transgressions of man may be turned to
the accomplishment of high purposes. As will be shown,
the sacrifice of Christ was ordained from before the foundation
of the world,<a name="FNanchor_189_189" id="FNanchor_189_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a> yet Judas who betrayed, and the blood-thirsty
Jews who brought about the crucifixion of the Son
of God, are none the less guilty of the awful crime.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>
<p><b>32.</b> It has become a common practice with mankind to
heap reproaches upon the progenitors of the family, and to
picture the supposedly blessed state in which we would be
living but for the Fall; whereas our first parents are entitled
to our deepest gratitude for their legacy to posterity,&mdash;the
means of winning glory, exaltation, and eternal lives, on
the battlefield of mortality. But for the opportunity thus
given, the spirits of God's offspring would have remained
forever in a state of innocent childhood; sinless through no
effort of their own; negatively saved, not from sin, but from
the opportunity of meeting sin; incapable of winning the
honors of victory because prevented from taking part in the
battle. As it is, they are heirs to the birthright of Adam's
descendants,&mdash;mortality, with its immeasurable possibilities
and its God-given freedom of action. From Father
Adam we have inherited all the ills to which flesh is heir;
but such are necessarily incident to the knowledge of good
and evil, by the proper use of which knowledge man may
become even as the Gods.<a name="FNanchor_190_190" id="FNanchor_190_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a></p>


<h4>NOTES.</h4>

<blockquote>

<p><b>1. Man's Agency is God-given.</b>&mdash;The following is an extract from a discourse
delivered by President Brigham Young, July 5, 1855. (See Journal of Discourses
of that date, and Millennial Star, vol. xx, p. 43.) "What is the foundation of the rights
of man? The Lord Almighty has organized man for the express purpose of becoming
an independent being like unto Himself, and has given him his individual agency. Man
is made in the likeness of his Creator, the great archetype of the human species, who
bestowed upon him the principles of eternity, planting immortality within him, and
leaving him at liberty to act in the way that seemeth good unto him;&mdash;to choose or refuse
for himself, to be a Latter-day Saint or a Wesleyan Methodist, to belong to the
Church of England, the oldest daughter of the Mother Church, to the old Mother herself,
to her sister the Greek Church, or to be an infidel and belong to no church. When
the kingdom of God is fully set up and established on the face of the earth, and takes
the pre-eminence over all other nations and kingdoms, it will protect the people in the
enjoyment of all their rights, no matter what they believe, what they profess, or what
they worship."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p><b>2. The Nature of Sin.</b>&mdash;The English word "sin" represents a very great
variety of terms occurring in the original languages, the literal translation of which bear
to one another a very great similarity. Thus, in the Old Testament, the following terms
among others occur:&mdash;<em>setim</em> (referred to in Psalms ci, 3), signifying "to deviate from the
way;" <em>shegagah</em> (Lev. iv, 2; Num. xv, 27), "to err in the way;" <em>avon</em>, "the crooked,
or perverted;" <em>avel</em>, "to turn aside." In the New Testament we find, <em>hemartia</em>, "the
missing of a mark;" <em>parabasis</em>, "the transgressing of a line;" <em>parakoe</em>, "disobedience
to a voice;" <em>paraptoma</em>, "falling from uprightness;" <em>agn&oelig;ma</em>, "unjustifiable ignorance;"
<em>hettema</em>, "giving only partial measure;" <em>anomia</em>, "non-observance of law;"
<em>plemmeleia</em>, "a discord." The above illustrations are taken mainly from Müller and
French. In all these expressions, the predominant idea is that of departure from the way
of God, of separation from His companionship by opposition to the Divine requirements.
Sin was introduced into the world from without; it was not a natural product of earth.
The seed of disobedience was planted in the mind of Eve by the
arch-fiend: that seed
took root; and much fruit, of the nature that we, with unguarded words, call calamity,
is the result. From these thorns and thistles of mortality, a Savior has been prepared
to deliver us.</p>

<p><b>3. Eden.</b>&mdash;In the Hebrew tongue, from which our word "Eden" is taken, this
term signifies something particularly delightful,&mdash;a place of pleasantness; the place is
also called "the garden of the Lord." One particular spot in the land of Eden was prepared
by the Lord as a garden; this was situated eastward in Eden. From the garden,
the parents of the race were expelled after the Fall, though it is reasonable to suppose
that they still dwelt in the land or region of Eden. We read that at a later date, Cain,
the first murderer, "went out from the presence of the Lord, and dwelt in the land of
Nod, on the east of Eden" (Gen. iv, 16). Though there is no uniform belief among
Christian scholars as to the geographical location of Eden, the majority claim that it was
in Persia; however, the most radical among the advocates of this view fail to prove any
marked resemblance between the region at present and the place described in the Bible.
The Latter-day Saints have more exact knowledge on the matter, a revelation having
been given through Joseph Smith, at Spring Hill, Mo., May 19, 1838, in which that place
is named by the Lord "Adam-ondi-Ahman, because, said he, it is the place where Adam
shall come to visit his people, or the Ancient of Days shall sit, as spoken of by Daniel
the prophet" (Doc. and Cov. cxvi). From another revelation we learn (Doc. and Cov.
cvii, 52-53) that three years before his death, Adam called together in the valley of Adam-ondi-Ahman
those of his sons who had been made High Priests, together with the rest of
his righteous posterity, and there bestowed upon them his patriarchal blessings, the
event being marked by special manifestations from the Lord (see also Doc. and Cov.
cxvii, 8). The Lord has pointed out in this day the exact location of the altar upon
which Adam offered sacrifices after his expulsion from the Garden (see Contributor,
Vol. vii, page 314). There is no authentic record of the human race having inhabited the
Eastern Hemisphere until after the flood. The Western Continent, called now the New
World, comprises indeed the oldest inhabited regions of earth. The west, not the east,
is the "cradle of nations."</p>

<p><b>4. The Serpent</b>, as stated, having aided the purposes of Satan, received from the
Lord a special curse (see Genesis iii, 13, 15, and the Pearl of Great Price, p. 16). The
creature was doomed to a life of degradation. Even from the standpoint of anatomy,
the serpent is a degraded type. Though a vertebrate,&mdash;a member of the highest sub-kingdom
of animals, it is devoid even of external limbs, and its means of locomotion are
of no higher order than are those of the worm and the caterpillar. In the scriptures, the
serpent is made the symbol of craft, subtlety, cunning, and danger.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p><b>5. Mortality Essential.</b>&mdash;President John Taylor, after discussing the succession
of events leading up to the Fall, says&mdash;"Thus it would appear that if
any of the links of this great chain had been broken, it would have interfered
with the comprehensive plan of the Almighty pertaining to the salvation and
eternal exaltation of those spirits who were His sons, and for whom principally the
world was made: that they, through submission to the requirements of the eternal
principle and law governing those matters, might possess bodies, and those bodies
united with the spirits might become living souls, and being the sons of God, and
made in the image of God, they through the atonement might be exalted, by obedience
to the law of the Gospel, to the Godhead."&mdash;<cite>Mediation and Atonement</cite>, p. 135.</p>

<p><b>6. Beneficent Results of the Fall.</b>&mdash;"'Honor thy father and thy mother.'
This was one of the ten special commandments given to Israel, during a grand display of
God's power and glory on Mount Sinai. In the past centuries of darkness it appears to
have lost its significance with the Christian world. They do not appear to realize that
honor is due to the first parents of the human race. They have been long taught that
Adam and Eve were great transgressors, and have mourned over the fact that they partook
of the forbidden fruit and brought death into the world. There is no possibility
that the fall of man was an accident or chance, any more than was his creation. If an
accident, then why was Christ prepared from before the foundation of the world as a
propitiation for sin, and to open up the way for man to immortality? Christ's mediation
was a sequence of the fall" (see Acts v, 31). "Without the fall there would have
been no broken law, and therefore nothing to repent of; and there could be no forgiveness
of sin without the atonement of Christ. The Book of Mormon makes this subject
very plain: 'And now, behold, if Adam had not transgressed, he would not have fallen;
but he would have remained in the Garden of Eden. And all things which were created,
must have remained in the same state which they were after they were created; and
they must have remained forever, and had no end. And they would have had no children;
wherefore they would have remained in a state of innocence, having no joy, for
they knew no misery; doing no good, for they knew no sin' (II Nephi ii, 22-23)....
We, the children of Adam, have no right to bring accusations against the Patriarch of
the race. But rather, we should rejoice with them, that through their fall and the atonement
of Jesus Christ, the way of eternal life has been opened up to us."&mdash;<cite>A Compendium
of the Doctrines of the Gospel</cite>: F. D. Richards and J. A. Little, pp. 3-4.</p>

<p><b>7. The Fall Fore-known.</b>&mdash;"'Mormonism' accepts the doctrine of the
Fall, and the account of the transgression in Eden, as set forth in Genesis; but it affirms
that none save Adam shall ever have to account for Adam's disobedience; that mankind
in general are absolutely absolved from the responsibility for that 'original sin,' and
that each shall answer for his own transgressions alone. That the Fall was foreknown
of God,&mdash;that it was the accepted means by which the necessary condition of
mortality should be inaugurated; and that a Redeemer was provided before the
world was. That general salvation, in the sense of redemption from the effects of
the Fall, comes to all without their seeking it; but that individual salvation or
rescue from the effects of personal sins is to be acquired by each for himself, by
faith and good works through the redemption wrought by Jesus Christ."&mdash;<cite>The
Philosophy of Mormonism</cite>: The Author; Improvement Era, Vol. IV, pp. 465-466.</p>

<h3>THE ATONEMENT, AND SALVATION.</h3>

<p><b>Article 3.</b>&mdash;We believe that through the atonement of Christ, all mankind may be

<p class="center">THE ATONEMENT.</p>

<p><b>1. The Atonement of Christ</b> is taught as a leading doctrine
by all sects professing Christianity. The expression
is so common a one, and the essential point of its signification
is so generally admitted, that definitions may appear to be
superfluous; nevertheless, there is a peculiar importance attached
to the use of the word atonement, in a theological
sense. The doctrine of the atonement comprises proof of
the divinity of Christ's earthly ministry; and the vicarious
nature of His death, as a fore-ordained and voluntary sacrifice,
intended for and efficacious as a propitiation for the
sins of mankind, thus becoming the means whereby salvation
may be obtained.</p>

<p><b>2.</b> The New Testament, which is properly regarded as
the scripture of Christ's mission among men, is imbued
throughout with the doctrine of salvation through the work
of atonement wrought by the Savior; and yet the word
atonement, occurs but once in the whole record; and in that
single instance, according to the opinion of most biblical
authorities, it is confessedly misused. The instance referred
to is found in the words of Paul addressed to the saints at
Rome:&mdash;"But we also joy in God through our Lord Jesus
Christ, by whom we have now received the atonement."<a name="FNanchor_191_191" id="FNanchor_191_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a>
The marginal rendering gives, instead of atonement, reconciliation,
and of this word a related form is used in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
preceding verse. A consistent translation, giving a full
agreement between the English and the Greek, would make
the verse quoted, and that immediately preceding it, read
in this way:&mdash;"For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled
to God by the death of his Son; much more, being
reconciled, we shall be saved by his life. And not only so,
but we also joy in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, by
whom we have now received the reconciliation."<a name="FNanchor_192_192" id="FNanchor_192_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a> The term
atonement occurs repeatedly in the Old Testament, and
with marked frequency in three of the books of the Pentateuch,
viz.: Exodus, Leviticus, and Numbers; and the sense
in which it is employed is invariably that of a sacrifice of
propitiation, usually associated with the death of an acceptable
victim, whereby reconciliation was to be effected between
God and His creatures.</p>

<p><b>3.</b> The structure of the word in its present form is suggestive
of this, the true meaning; it is literally <em>at-one-ment</em>,
"denoting reconciliation, or the bringing into agreement of
those who have been estranged."<a name="FNanchor_193_193" id="FNanchor_193_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a> And such is the significance
of the saving sacrifice of the Redeemer, whereby He
expiated the transgression of the Fall, through which came
death into the world, and provided ready and efficient means
for man's attainment of immortality through reconciliation
with God.</p>

<p><b>4. Nature of the Atonement.</b>&mdash;The atonement wrought
by Jesus Christ is a necessary sequence of the transgression
of Adam; and, as the infinite foreknowledge of God made
clear to Him the one even before Adam was placed on earth,
so the Father's boundless mercy prepared a Savior for mankind
before the world was framed. Through the Fall,
Adam and Eve have entailed the conditions of mortality
upon their descendants; therefore all beings born of earthly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
parents are subject to bodily death. The sentence of banishment
from the presence of God was in the nature of a
spiritual death; and that penalty, which was visited upon
our first parents in the day of their transgression, has likewise
followed as the common heritage of humanity. As
this penalty came into the world through an individual act,
it would be manifestly unjust to cause all to eternally suffer
therefrom, without a chance of deliverance. Therefore was
the promised sacrifice of Jesus Christ ordained as a propitiation
for broken law, whereby Justice could be fully satisfied,
and Mercy be left free to exercise her beneficent influence
over the souls of mankind.<a name="FNanchor_194_194" id="FNanchor_194_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a> All the details of the glorious
plan, by which the salvation of the human family is assured,
may not lie within the understanding of man; but surely
man has learned, from his futile attempts to fathom the
primary cause of the phenomena of nature, that his powers
of comprehension are limited; and he will admit, that to
deny an effect because of his inability to elucidate its
cause, would be to forfeit his claims as an observing and
reasoning being.</p>

<p><b>5.</b> Simple as is the plan of redemption in its general features,
it is confessedly a mystery to the finite mind in detail.
President John Taylor has written in this wise:&mdash;"In some
mysterious, incomprehensible way, Jesus assumed the responsibility
which naturally would have devolved upon
Adam; but which could only be accomplished through the
mediation of Himself; and by taking upon Himself their
sorrows, assuming their responsibilities, and bearing their
transgressions or sins. In a manner to us incomprehensible
and inexplicable, He bore the weight of the sins of the
whole world, not only of Adam, but of his posterity; and
in doing that, opened the kingdom of heaven, not only to all
believers and all who obeyed the law of God, but to more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
than one half of the human family who die before they
come to years of maturity, as well as to the heathen, who,
having died without law, will through His mediation be resurrected
without law, and be judged without law, and thus
participate, according to their capacity, works, and worth,
in the blessings of His atonement."<a name="FNanchor_195_195" id="FNanchor_195_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a></p>

<p><b>6.</b> But, however incomplete may be our comprehension of
the scheme of redemption through Christ's vicarious sacrifice
in all its parts, we cannot reject it without becoming
infidel; for it stands as the fundamental doctrine of all
scripture, the very essence of the spirit of prophecy and
revelation, the most prominent of all the declarations of God
unto man.</p>

<p><b>7. The Atonement a Vicarious Sacrifice.</b>&mdash;It is to many a
matter of surpassing wonder that the voluntary sacrifice of
a single being could be made to operate as a means of
ransom for the rest of mankind. In this, as in other things,
the scriptures are explicable only by the spirit of scriptural
interpretation. The sacred writings of ancient times, the
words of modern prophets, the traditions of mankind, the
rites of sacrifice, and even the sacrileges of heathen idolatries,
involve the idea of vicarious atonement. God has
never refused to accept an offering made by one who is
authorized on behalf of those who are in any way incapable
of doing the required service themselves. The
scape-goat,<a name="FNanchor_196_196" id="FNanchor_196_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a> and the altar victim<a name="FNanchor_197_197" id="FNanchor_197_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a> of ancient Israel, if
offered with repentance and contrition, were accepted by the
Lord in mitigation of the sins of the people. It is interesting
to note, that while the ceremonies of sacrifice formed so
large and so essential a part of the Mosaic requirements,
these rites long ante-dated the establishment of Israel as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
distinct people; for, as already shown, altar sacrifice was
rendered by Adam.<a name="FNanchor_198_198" id="FNanchor_198_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a> The symbolism of the sacrificing of
animals as a prototype of the great sacrifice to follow on
Calvary was thus instituted with the beginning of human
history.</p>

<p><b>8.</b> The many kinds of sacrifice prescribed by the Mosaic
law are clearly classified under the headings bloody and
bloodless. Offerings of the first order only, involving the
infliction of death, were acceptable in propitiation or atonement
for sin, and the victim had to be clean, healthy, and
without spot or blemish. And so for the great sacrifice, the
effects of which were to be infinite, only an innocent subject
could be accepted. It was Christ's right, as the only
sinless Being on earth, and as the Only Begotten of the
Father, and above all as the One ordained to this mission in
the heavens, to be the Redeemer of mankind; and though
the exercise of this right involved a sacrifice, the extent of
which man cannot comprehend, yet Christ made that
sacrifice willingly and voluntarily. To the last He had the
means of terminating the tortures of His persecutors, by a
simple exercise of His powers as one of the Godhead.<a name="FNanchor_199_199" id="FNanchor_199_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a> In
some way, though that way may be inexplicable to us,
Christ took upon Himself the sins of mankind. The means
may be to our finite minds a mystery, yet the results are our
salvation.</p>

<p><b>9.</b> Something of the Savior's agony as He groaned under
this load of guilt, which to Him, as a type of purity, must
have been in itself repulsive, He has told us through the
prophet's words in this day: "For behold, I, God, have
suffered these things for all, that they might not suffer if
they would repent; but if they would not repent they
must suffer even as I, which suffering caused myself,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
even God, the greatest of all, to tremble because of pain,
and to bleed at every pore, and to suffer both body and
spirit; and would that I might not drink the bitter
cup, and shrink:&mdash;Nevertheless, glory be to the Father,
and I partook and finished my preparations unto the children
of men."<a name="FNanchor_200_200" id="FNanchor_200_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a> Further instances of the validity of vicarious
service are found in the ordinances of baptism for the dead<a name="FNanchor_201_201" id="FNanchor_201_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a>

<p><b>10. Christ's Sacrifice was Voluntary and Love-inspired.</b>&mdash;We
have noted in passing that Christ gave His life willingly
and voluntarily for the redemption of mankind. He offered
Himself, in the great Council of the Gods, as the subject of
the atoning sacrifice made necessary by the fore-seen transgression
of the first man; and the free agency shown and
exercised in this, the early stage of His saving mission, was
retained to the very last of the agonizing fulfillment of the
accepted plan. Though He lived on earth a man in every
particular that concerns us in our regard for Him as an example
of Godliness in humanity, yet it is to be remembered
that, though born of a mortal mother, he was begotten by
an immortal Sire; and so had combined within His being the
capacity to die, and the power to set death at defiance. He
gave His life; it was not taken from Him. Note the significance
of His own declaration:&mdash;"Therefore doth my
Father love me, because I lay down my life that I may take
it up again. No man taketh it from me, but I lay it down
of myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power
to take it again."<a name="FNanchor_203_203" id="FNanchor_203_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a> On another occasion Jesus testified of
Himself in this way:&mdash;"For as the Father hath life in himself,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
so hath he given to the Son to have life in himself; and
hath given him authority to execute judgment also, because
he is the Son of man."<a name="FNanchor_204_204" id="FNanchor_204_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a> And then amid the tragic scenes
of the betrayal, when one who had been a professed follower
and friend gave Him with a traitorous kiss to His persecutors,
when Peter, with a rashness prompted by righteous
zeal, drew and used the sword in His defence, the Master
said:&mdash;"Thinkest thou that I cannot now pray to my
Father, and he shall presently give me more than twelve
legions of angels? But how then shall the scriptures be
fulfilled, that thus it must be?"<a name="FNanchor_205_205" id="FNanchor_205_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a> And on to the bitter end,
marked by the expiring though triumphant cry "It is finished,"
the incarnated God held in subjection within Himself
the power to thwart His murderers, had He so willed.</p>

<p><b>11.</b> The motive inspiring and sustaining Him through
all the scenes of His mission, from the time of His primeval
ordination to the moment of victorious consummation on
the cross, was two-fold; first, the desire to do His Father's
will, in accomplishing the salvation of man; second, His
love for humanity, of whose welfare and destiny He had
assumed charge. Far from cherishing the least feeling of
vindictiveness against those, who, in defiance of the laws of
God and man, put Him to ignominious death, He entertained
for them compassion to the last. Hear Him in the
hour of supreme agony, praying aloud, "Father, forgive
them, for they know not what they do."<a name="FNanchor_206_206" id="FNanchor_206_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a> Not less is the
Father's love, as shown by His accepting the Son's offer,
and permitting Him whom He delighted to call His Beloved,
to suffer as only a God could suffer:&mdash;"For God so loved
the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever
believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
life. For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn
the world, but that the world through him might be
saved."<a name="FNanchor_207_207" id="FNanchor_207_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a> And further, we hear the teaching of the apostle,
whom the Savior loved so well, "In this was manifested the
love of God toward us, because that God sent his only
begotten Son into the world that we might live through
him."<a name="FNanchor_208_208" id="FNanchor_208_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a></p>

<p><b>12. The Atonement Fore-ordained and Fore-told.</b>&mdash;As already
shown, the plan of the Father to open a way for the redemption
of mankind, then to leave all men free to exercise
their own agency, was adopted by the Council in heaven to the
rejection of Lucifer's plan of compulsion. Even at that
remote period, Christ was thus ordained as a Mediator for
all mankind; in fact, "a covenant was entered into between
Him and His Father, in which He agreed to atone for the
sins of the world, and He thus, as stated, became a 'Lamb
slain from before the foundation of the world.'"<a name="FNanchor_209_209" id="FNanchor_209_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a> The
prophets of old, many of whom lived centuries before the
time of Christ's coming in the flesh, testified of Him and
of the great work He had been ordained to perform. These
men of God had been permitted to behold in prophetic
visions many of the scenes incident to the Savior's earthly
mission; and they solemnly bore record of the manifestations.
Indeed, the testimony of Christ is the spirit of
prophecy, and without it no person can rightly claim the
distinction of being a prophet of God. Adam's despair, on
being driven from Eden, was changed to joy when, through
revelation, he learned of the plan of redemption to be
wrought by the Son of God in the flesh.<a name="FNanchor_210_210" id="FNanchor_210_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a> Righteous Enoch

declaration was made by John the Baptist,<a name="FNanchor_218_218" id="FNanchor_218_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a> the prophet of
the Highest, designated by the Savior as more than a
prophet; he it was who baptized the Christ, and who witnessed
the Father's words associated with the visible sign of
the Holy Ghost, concerning the mission of the Son.</p>

<p><b>13.</b> Should there be any doubt as to the application of such
prophecies, we have the conclusive testimony of Christ that
they refer to Himself. On that memorable day, immediately
following His resurrection, while walking incognito
with two of His disciples on the road to Emmaus, He taught
them the scriptures that had been written concerning the
Son of God; "Beginning at Moses, and all the prophets, he
expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning
himself."<a name="FNanchor_219_219" id="FNanchor_219_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a> A few hours after this event, the Lord
appeared to the Eleven at Jerusalem. He operated upon
their minds "that they might understand the scriptures; and
said unto them, Thus it is written, and thus it behoved
Christ to suffer,"<a name="FNanchor_220_220" id="FNanchor_220_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a> in this way testifying that He was fulfilling
a previously ordained plan. Peter, one of the Savior's
most intimate earthly associates, refers to Him as "a Lamb
without blemish and without spot, who verily was fore-ordained
before the foundation of the world."<a name="FNanchor_221_221" id="FNanchor_221_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a> In his epistle
to the Romans, Paul characterizes Christ as the one "Whom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his
blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins

New Testament<a name="FNanchor_223_223" id="FNanchor_223_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a> writings abound in proofs of the Messiah's
great work.</p>

<p><b>14.</b> Book of Mormon prophets are characterized by their
full testimonies concerning the Messiah. Because of his
purity of faith, the brother of Jared was permitted to behold
the Savior of mankind, twenty-two centuries prior to
the meridian of time, and to be shown that man was created
after the image of the Lord, at the same time being taught
of the Father's purpose that the Son take upon Himself
flesh and dwell on earth.<a name="FNanchor_224_224" id="FNanchor_224_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a> Note the personal declaration of
the fore-ordained Redeemer to this prophet:&mdash;"Behold, I am
he who was prepared from the foundation of the world to
redeem my people. Behold, I am Jesus Christ. I am the
Father and the Son. In me shall all mankind have light,
and that eternally, even they who shall believe on my name;
and they shall become my sons and my daughters."<a name="FNanchor_225_225" id="FNanchor_225_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a></p>

<p><b>15.</b> Nephi records the prophecy of his father Lehi concerning
the future appearing of the Son in the flesh, His baptism,
death, and resurrection; this prophetic utterance specifies the
exact date of the Savior's birth, viz., six hundred years after
the time of Lehi's exodus from Jerusalem. The mission of
John the Baptist is described, and even the place of baptism
is designated.<a name="FNanchor_226_226" id="FNanchor_226_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a> Shortly after the time of Lehi's vision,
Nephi was shown by the Spirit the same things, as also many
others, some of which he has written, but the greater part<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
of which he was forbidden to write, as another, the Apostle
John, had been ordained to set them forth in a book which
should form part of the Bible. But, from his partial account
of his vision, we learn that he saw in Nazareth, Mary the
Virgin, first alone, and shortly afterward with a child in her
arms; the demonstrator of the vision informed him that the
infant was the Lamb of God, the Son of the Eternal Father.
Then Nephi beheld the Son ministering among the children
of men, proclaiming the word, healing the sick, and working
many other wondrous miracles; he saw John, the
prophet of the wilderness, going before Him; he beheld the
Savior baptized of John, and the Holy Ghost descending
upon Him with the visible sign of the dove. Then he saw
and prophesied that twelve chosen apostles would follow the
Savior in His ministry; that the Son would be taken and
judged of men, and finally be slain. Piercing the future,
even beyond the time of the crucifixion, Nephi beheld the
strife of the world against the apostles of the Lamb, and
the final triumph of God's cause.<a name="FNanchor_227_227" id="FNanchor_227_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a></p>

<p><b>16.</b> Jacob, the brother of Nephi, prophesied to his brethren

that He would be scourged and crucified of them.<a name="FNanchor_228_228" id="FNanchor_228_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a> King

<p><b>17.</b> The ancient scriptures, then, are plain in declaring
that Christ came upon the earth to do a work previously
allotted. He lived, suffered and died, in accordance with a
plan which was framed in righteousness for the redemption
of the children of Adam, even before the world was. Equally
important and explicit is the word of modern revelation
through which the Son has declared Himself as Alpha and
Omega, the beginning and the end, man's Advocate with
the Father, the universal Redeemer.<a name="FNanchor_237_237" id="FNanchor_237_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a> Let us consider a
single citation from the many revelations concerning Christ
given in the present dispensation:&mdash;"Listen to the voice of

today as yesterday and forever. I am Jesus Christ, the Son
of God, who was crucified for the sins of the world, even as
many as will believe on my name, that they may become the
sons of God, even one in me as I am in the Father, as the

<p><b>18. The Extent of the Atonement</b> is infinite, applying
alike to all descendants of Adam. Even the unbeliever,
and the heathen, and the child who dies before reaching the
years of discretion, are redeemed by the Savior's self-sacrifice
from all the consequences of the Fall.<a name="FNanchor_239_239" id="FNanchor_239_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a> It is
conclusively proved by the scripture that the resurrection
of the body is one of the victories achieved by Christ<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
through His atoning sacrifice. He Himself proclaimed the
eternal truth, "I am the resurrection and the life;"<a name="FNanchor_240_240" id="FNanchor_240_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a> and

fruits of them that slept."<a name="FNanchor_241_241" id="FNanchor_241_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a> Now, the scriptures leave no
room for doubt concerning the fact that the resurrection
will be universal. The Savior announced to his apostles
the beginning of this work of deliverance from the tomb;
hear His words, "Marvel not at this; for the hour is coming,
in the which all that are in their graves shall hear his voice,
and shall come forth; they that have done good unto the
resurrection of life, and they that done evil unto the
resurrection of damnation;"<a name="FNanchor_242_242" id="FNanchor_242_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a> or, as the latter part of the
declaration has been rendered through inspiration in the
present day, "They who have done good, in the resurrection
of the just: and they who have done evil in the resurrection
of the unjust."<a name="FNanchor_243_243" id="FNanchor_243_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a></p>

<p><b>19.</b> Paul refers to the doctrine of a universal resurrection
as being so well proved that even his accusers had to admit
the truth, "that there shall be a resurrection of the dead,
both of the just and unjust."<a name="FNanchor_244_244" id="FNanchor_244_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a> On another occasion he said
"For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made
alive."<a name="FNanchor_245_245" id="FNanchor_245_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a> Furthermore, John the Revelator testifies of his
vision concerning futurity, "And I saw the dead, small and
great, stand before God.... And the sea gave up the
dead which were in it, and death and hell delivered up the
dead which were in them."<a name="FNanchor_246_246" id="FNanchor_246_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a> Thus it is plain that the effect
of the atonement, as far as it applies to the victory over
temporal or bodily death, involves the entire race. It is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
equally clear that the release from Adam's legacy of spiritual
death, or banishment from the presence of God, will be
similarly universal; so that if any man lose salvation, such
loss will be due to himself, and in no way be dependent upon
the Fall. The doctrine that the gift of redemption through
Christ is free to all men, was specifically taught by the
apostles of old. Thus Paul says:&mdash;"Therefore, as by the
offence of one, judgment came upon all men to condemnation;
even so by the righteousness of one the free gift came upon
all men to the justification of life."<a name="FNanchor_247_247" id="FNanchor_247_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a> And further:&mdash;there is
"one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus;
who gave himself a ransom for all."<a name="FNanchor_248_248" id="FNanchor_248_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a> John spoke of the
Redeemer's sacrifice, saying:&mdash;"And he is the propitiation
for our sins; and not for ours only, but also for the sins of
the whole world."<a name="FNanchor_249_249" id="FNanchor_249_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a></p>

<p><b>20.</b> The same great truths were taught among the
Nephites. Benjamin, the righteous king, preached of
"the atonement which was prepared from the foundation
of the world for all mankind, which ever were ever since the
fall of Adam, or who are, or who ever shall be, even unto
the end of the world."<a name="FNanchor_250_250" id="FNanchor_250_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a> In revelation of the present day we
read of Christ's having come into the world, to suffer and
to die, "That through him all might be saved whom the
Father had put into his power and made by him."<a name="FNanchor_251_251" id="FNanchor_251_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a></p>

<p><b>21.</b> But besides this universal application of the atonement,
whereby all men are redeemed from the effects of
Adam's transgression, both with respect to the death of the
body and the taint of inherited sin, there is a special
application of the same great sacrifice, as a means of
propitiation for individual sins, through the faith and good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
works of the sinner. This two-fold effect of the atonement
is implied in the article of our faith now under consideration.
The first effect is to secure to all mankind alike,
exemption from the otherwise terrible effects of the Fall,
thus providing a plan of <em>General Salvation</em>. The second
effect is to open a way for <em>Individual Salvation</em> whereby mankind
may secure forgiveness of personal sins. As these sins
are the result of individual acts, it is just that forgiveness
for them should be conditioned on individual compliance
with prescribed requirements,&mdash;"obedience to the laws and
ordinances of the gospel."</p>

<p><b>22. The General Effect of the Atonement</b>, so far as it applies
to all who have arrived at years of accountability and
judgment, has been made sufficiently clear perhaps from
the scriptures already quoted. Its application to children
may properly receive our further attention. The Church of
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints teaches as a doctrine
founded on reason, justice, and scripture, that all children
are innocent in the sight of God, and that, until they reach
an age of personal responsibility, baptism is not requisite or
proper in their behalf; that, in short, they are saved through
the atonement of Christ. To a degree, children are born
heirs to the good or evil natures of their parents; the effects
of heredity in determining character are readily recognized.
Good and evil tendencies, blessings and curses, are transmitted
from generation to generation. Through this
divinely appointed order, the justice of which is plain in
the revealed light of knowledge concerning the pre-existent
state of the spirits of mankind, the children of Adam are
natural heirs to the calamities of mortality; but through
Christ's atonement they are all redeemed from the curses of
this fallen state; the debt, which comes to them as a legacy,
is paid for them, and thus are they left free. Children who
die free of sin are entirely innocent in the eyes of God, even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
though they be the offspring of transgressors. We read in
the Book of Mormon:&mdash;"Little children cannot repent;
wherefore it is awful wickedness to deny the pure mercies
of God unto them, for they are all alive in him because of
his mercy.... For behold that all little children are
alive in Christ, and also all they that are without the law.
For the power of redemption cometh on all that have no
law."<a name="FNanchor_252_252" id="FNanchor_252_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a></p>

<p><b>23.</b> The prophet Mormon writing to his son Moroni
expressed in the following manner his conviction of children's
innocence:&mdash;"Listen to the words of Christ, your Redeemer,
your Lord and your God. Behold, I came into the world
not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance: the whole
need no physician, but they that are sick; wherefore little
children are whole, for they are not capable of committing
sin; wherefore, the curse of Adam is taken from them in me,
that it hath no power over them.... Behold I say
unto you, That this thing shall ye teach, repentance and
baptism unto those who are accountable and capable of
committing sin; yea, teach parents that they must repent
and be baptized, and humble themselves as their little
children, and they shall all be saved with their little
children. And their little children need no repentance,
neither baptism. Behold, baptism is unto repentance to
the fulfilling the commandments unto the remission of sins.
But little children are alive in Christ even from the foundation
of the world."<a name="FNanchor_253_253" id="FNanchor_253_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a></p>

<p><b>24.</b> And in a revelation through the prophet Joseph
Smith in this dispensation, the Lord has said:&mdash;"But behold
I say unto you, that little children are redeemed from the
foundation of the world through mine Only Begotten;

Satan to tempt little children until they begin to become
accountable before me."<a name="FNanchor_254_254" id="FNanchor_254_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a> President John Taylor, after
citing instances of Christ's affection for little children, and
proofs of the innocent condition in which they are regarded
in heaven, says:&mdash;"Without Adam's transgression, those
children could not have existed; through the atonement
they are placed in a state of salvation without any act of
their own. These would embrace, according to the opinion
of statisticians, more than one half of the human family,
who can attribute their salvation only to the mediation and
atonement of the Savior."<a name="FNanchor_255_255" id="FNanchor_255_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a></p>

<p><b>25. The Special or Individual Effect of the Atonement</b>
makes it possible for any and every soul to obtain absolution
from the dread effect of personal sins, through the
mediation of Christ; but such saving intercession is to be
invoked by individual effort as manifested through faith,
repentance, and continued works of righteousness. The
laws under which individual salvation is obtainable have
been prescribed by Christ, whose right it is to say how the
blessings of His own sacrifice shall be administered. All
men are in need of the Savior's mediation, for all are transgressors.
So taught the apostles of old:&mdash;"For all have
sinned, and come short of the glory of God."<a name="FNanchor_256_256" id="FNanchor_256_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a> And again:&mdash;"If
we say that we have no sin we deceive ourselves, and
the truth is not in us."<a name="FNanchor_257_257" id="FNanchor_257_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a> Now, that the blessing of redemption
from individual sins, while free for all to attain, is
nevertheless conditioned on individual effort, is as plainly declared
as is the truth of unconditional redemption from
the effects of the Fall. There is a judgment ordained for
all, and all will be judged "according to their works." The
free agency of man enables him to choose or reject, to follow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
the path of life, or the road that leads to destruction;
it is but just that he be held to answer for the exercise of
his freedom, and that he meet the results of his acts.</p>

<p><b>26.</b> Hence the justice of the scriptural doctrine that
salvation comes to the individual only through obedience.
"He became the author of eternal salvation unto all them
that obey him"<a name="FNanchor_258_258" id="FNanchor_258_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a> said Paul of the Christ. And further:&mdash;God
"will render to every man according to his deeds: To
them who, by patient continuance in well doing, seek for
glory and honor and immortality, eternal life: But unto
them that are contentious, and do not obey the truth, but
obey unrighteousness, indignation and wrath, tribulation
and anguish, upon every soul of man that doeth evil, of the
Jew first, and also of the Gentile; But glory, honor, and
peace, to every man that worketh good, to the Jew first,
and also to the Gentile: For there is no respect of persons
with God."<a name="FNanchor_259_259" id="FNanchor_259_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a> To these may be added the words of the risen
Lord, "He that believeth, and is baptized, shall be saved;
and he that believeth not, shall be damned."<a name="FNanchor_260_260" id="FNanchor_260_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a></p>

<p><b>27.</b> Consider further the prophecy of King Benjamin
proclaimed to the Nephite multitude:&mdash;Christ's blood
"atoneth for the sins of those who have fallen by the transgression
of Adam, who have died, not knowing the will of
God concerning them, or who have ignorantly sinned. But
wo, wo unto him who knoweth that he rebelleth against
God; for salvation cometh to none such, except it be through
repentance and faith on the Lord Jesus Christ."<a name="FNanchor_261_261" id="FNanchor_261_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a> But why
multiply scriptural citations when the whole tenor of sacred
writ supports the doctrine? Without Christ no man can be
saved, and the salvation provided at the cost of Christ's
sufferings and bodily death is offered upon certain clearly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
defined conditions only; and these are summarized under
"obedience to the laws and ordinances of the gospel."</p>

<p><b>28. Salvation and Exaltation.</b>&mdash;Some degree of salvation
will come to all who have not forfeited their right to it; exaltation
is given to those only who by active labors have won a
claim to God's merciful liberality by which it is bestowed.
Of the saved, not all will be exalted to the higher glories;
rewards will not be bestowed in violation of justice; punishments
will not be meted out to the ignoring of mercy's
claims. No one can be admitted to any order of glory, in
short, no soul can be saved until justice has been satisfied
for violated law. Our belief in the universal application of
the atonement implies no supposition that all mankind will
be saved with like endowments of glory and power. In the
kingdom of God there are numerous degrees or gradations
provided for those who are worthy of them; in the house of
our Father there are many mansions, into which only
those who are prepared are admitted. The old sectarian
idea, that in the hereafter there will be but two places for
the souls of mankind,&mdash;heaven and hell, with the same glory
in all parts of the one, and the same terrors throughout the
other,&mdash;is wholly untenable in the light of divine revelation.
Through the direct word of the Lord we learn of varied
degrees of glory.</p>

<p><b>29. Degrees of Glory.</b>&mdash;The revelations of God have
defined the following principal kingdoms or degrees of
glory, as prepared through Christ for the children of men:</p>

<p>I. <em>The Celestial Glory.</em><a name="FNanchor_262_262" id="FNanchor_262_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a>&mdash;There are some who have striven
to obey all the Divine commandments, who have accepted the
testimony of Christ, and received the Holy Spirit; these
are they who have overcome evil by godly works, and who
are therefore entitled to the highest glory; these belong to
the Church of the First Born, unto whom the Father has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
given all things; they are made Kings and Priests of the
Most High, after the order of Melchisedek; they possess
celestial bodies, "whose glory is that of the sun, even the
glory of God, the highest of all, whose glory the sun of the
firmament is written of as being typical;" they indeed are
admitted to the celestial company, being crowned with the
celestial glory, which makes them Gods.</p>

<p>II. <em>The Terrestrial Glory.</em><a name="FNanchor_263_263" id="FNanchor_263_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a>&mdash;We read of those who receive
glory of a secondary order, differing from the highest as "the
moon differs from the sun in the firmament;" these are they
who, though honorable, were still in darkness, blinded by the
craftiness of men, and unable to receive and obey the higher
laws of God, they proved "not valiant in the testimony of
Jesus," and therefore are not entitled to the fulness of glory.</p>

<p>III. <em>The Telestial Glory.</em>&mdash;We learn of a still lower kind of
glory, differing from the higher orders as the stars differ
from the brighter orbs of the firmament; this is given to
those who received not the testimony of Christ, but who
still did not deny the Holy Spirit; who have led lives exempting
them from the heaviest punishment, yet whose
redemption will be delayed till the last resurrection. In the
telestial world there are innumerable degrees of glory,
comparable to the varying lustre of the stars.<a name="FNanchor_264_264" id="FNanchor_264_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a> Yet all who
receive of any one of these orders of glory are at last saved,
and upon them Satan will finally have no claim. Even the
telestial glory, as we are told by those who have been
permitted to gaze upon it, "surpasses all understanding;
and no man knows it except him to whom God has revealed
it."<a name="FNanchor_265_265" id="FNanchor_265_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a> Then there are those who have lost all claim upon
the immediate mercy of God; whose deeds have numbered
them with Perdition and his angels.<a name="FNanchor_266_266" id="FNanchor_266_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a></p>

<h4>NOTES.</h4>

<blockquote>

<p><b>1. The Atonement Proved by Evidence.</b>&mdash;"It is often asked: 'How is it
that through the sacrifice of one who is innocent salvation may be purchased for those
under the dominion of death?' We observe in passing that what should most concern
man is not so much how it is that such is the case, but is it a fact?... To
that question the blood sprinkled upon a thousand Jewish altars, and the smoke that
darkened the heavens for ages from burnt offerings, answer yes.... Even the
mythology of heathen nations retains the idea of an atonement that either has been, or is
to be made for mankind. Fantastic, distorted, confused, buried under the rubbish of
savage superstition it may be, but it nevertheless exists. So easily traced, so distinct is
this feature of heathen mythology, that some writers have endeavored to prove that the
gospel plan of redemption was derived from heathen mythology. Whereas the fact is
that the gospel was understood and extensively preached in the earliest ages; men retained
in their tradition a knowledge of those principles or parts of them, and however
much they have been distorted, traces of them may still be found in nearly all the
mythologies of the world. The prophets of the Jewish scriptures answer the question
in the affirmative. The writers of the New Testament make Christ's atonement the
principal theme of their discourses and epistles. The Book of Mormon, speaking as the
voice of an entire continent of people whose prophets and righteous men sought and
found God, testifies to the same great fact. The revelations of God as given through
the Prophet Joseph Smith are replete with passages confirming this doctrine."&mdash;Roberts'
<cite>Outlines of Ecclesiastical History</cite>, Section viii, 6.</p>

<p><b>2. Redemption from the Fall Universal and Unconditional.</b>&mdash;"We
believe that through the sufferings, death, and atonement of Jesus Christ all mankind,
without one exception, are to be completely and fully redeemed, both body and spirit,
from the endless banishment and curse to which they were consigned by Adam's transgression;
and that this universal salvation and redemption of the whole human family
from the endless penalty of the original sin, is effected without any conditions whatever
on their part; that is, they are not required to believe or repent, or be baptized, or
do anything else, in order to be redeemed from that penalty; for whether they believe
or disbelieve; whether they repent or remain impenitent, whether they are baptized or
unbaptized, whether they keep the commandments or break them, whether they are
righteous or unrighteous, it will make no difference in relation to their redemption, both
soul and body, from the penalty of Adam's transgression. The most righteous man that
ever lived on the earth, and the most wicked wretch of the whole human family, were
both placed under the same curse without any transgression or agency of their own, and
they both alike will be redeemed from that curse, without any agency or conditions on
their part."&mdash;Apostle Orson Pratt in <cite>Remarkable Visions</cite>.</p>

<p><b>3. Christ the Author of our Salvation.</b>&mdash;President John Taylor speaks of
the death of Christ as an expiatory sacrifice, and adds:&mdash;"The Savior thus becomes
master of the situation,&mdash;the debt is paid, the redemption made, the covenant fulfilled,
justice satisfied, the will of God done, and all power is now given into the hands of the
Son of God,&mdash;the power of the resurrection, the power of the redemption, the power of
salvation, the power to enact laws for the carrying out and accomplishment of this
design.... The plan, the arrangement, the agreement, the covenant was made,
entered into and accepted, before the foundation of the world; it was prefigured by
sacrifices, and was carried out and consummated on the Cross. Hence, being the Mediator<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
between God and man, He becomes by right the Dictator and Director on earth and in
heaven for the living and for the dead, for the past, the present, and the future, pertaining
to man as associated with this earth or the heavens, in time or eternity, the Captain
of our salvation, the Apostle and High Priest of our profession, the Lord and Giver of
life."&mdash;<cite>Mediation and Atonement</cite>, Pres. John Taylor, p. 171.</p>

<p><b>4. The Atonement Inaugurated by Christ.</b>&mdash;"The Apostle Paul quite
comprehensively sums up the results of Christ's death and resurrection: 'But now is
Christ risen from the dead, and become the first fruits of them that slept. For since by
man came death, by man came also the resurrection of the dead. For as in Adam all
die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive' (I Cor. xv, 21-22). That is, death having
come on all men through the disobedience of Adam, so must all be raised to immortality
and eternal life through the death and resurrection of Christ. Paul also asserted that
'the last enemy that shall be destroyed is death' (verse 26). John the Revelator declares
that he saw death and hell cast into the lake of fire (Rev. xx, 14). The atonement, as
wrought out by Jesus Christ, further signifies that He has opened up the way for man's
redemption from his own sins, through faith in Christ's sufferings, death, and resurrection.
The Apostle Paul well expresses this: 'For all have sinned, and come short of the
glory of God; being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ
Jesus: whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare
his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of
God' (Romans iii, 23-26). These passages evidence that redemption from death, through
the sufferings of Christ, is for all men, both the righteous and the wicked; for this
earth, and for all things created upon it. The whole tenor of the scriptures assures us
that, while they may be sure of resurrection from death, regardless of their personal acts,
yet they will be rewarded for their works, whether they be good or evil, and that redemption
from personal sins can only be obtained through obedience to the requirements
of the Gospel, and a life of good works. The transgression of Adam being infinite in its
consequences, those consequences cannot be averted, except through an infinite atonement."&mdash;<cite>Compendium</cite>,
F. D. Richards &amp; J. A. Little, pp. 8-9.</p>

<p><b>5. The Atonement Necessary.</b>&mdash;"In the economy of God and the plan proposed
by the Almighty, it was provided that man was to be placed under a law apparently
simple in itself, yet the test of that law was fraught with the gravest consequences. The
observance of that law would secure eternal life, and the penalty for the violation of that
law was death.... If the law had not been broken, man would have lived;
but would man thus living have been capable of perpetuating his species, and of thus
fulfilling the designs of God in preparing tabernacles for the spirits which had been
created in the spirit world? And further, could they have had the need of a mediator,
who was to act as a propitiation for the violation of this law, which it would appear
from the circumstances was destined to be broken; or could the eternal increase and
perpetuity of man have been continued, and his high exaltation to the Godhead
been accomplished, without the propitiatory atonement and sacrifice of the Son of
God?"&mdash;<cite>Mediation and Atonement</cite>, Pres. John Taylor, pp. 128-129.</p>

<h3>FAITH AND REPENTANCE.</h3>


<blockquote>

<p><b>Article 4.</b>&mdash;We believe that the first principles and ordinances of the Gospel are
(1) Faith in the Lord Jesus Christ; (2) Repentance; ...</p></blockquote>


<p class="center">FAITH.</p>

<p><b>1. Nature of Faith.</b>&mdash;The predominating sense in which
the term faith is used throughout the scriptures is that of
full confidence and trust in the being, purposes, and words
of God. Such trust, if it be implicit, will remove all doubt
concerning things accomplished or promised of God, even
though such things be not apparent to or explicable by the
ordinary senses of mortality; hence arises the definition of
faith given by Paul: "Now faith is the substance [i.e.
confidence, or assurance] of things hoped for, the evidence
[i.e. the demonstration or proof] of things not seen."<a name="FNanchor_267_267" id="FNanchor_267_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a> It
is plain that such a feeling of trust may exist in different
persons in varying degrees; indeed, faith may manifest
itself from the incipient feeble state which is little more
than mere belief, scarcely free from hesitation and fear, to
the strength of abiding confidence that sets doubt and
sophistry at defiance.</p>

<p><b>2. Belief, Faith, and Knowledge</b>, while intimately related
and ofttimes regarded as one, are in reality not identical.
The terms faith and belief are sometimes used as synonyms,
nevertheless each of them has a specific and definite meaning
in our language, although in early English there was virtually
no distinction between them, and therefore the words
are used interchangeably in the ancient scriptures. Belief
may consist in a merely intellectual assent, whilst faith implies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
such confidence and conviction as will impel to action.
Dictionary authority justifies us in drawing a distinction
between the two, according to present usage in English;
and this authority defines belief as a simple assent to the
truth or actuality of anything, excluding however the moral
element of responsibility through such assent, which is embraced
by faith. Belief is in a sense passive,&mdash;a mental
agreement or acceptance only; faith is active and positive,&mdash;such
a reliance and confidence as will lead to works. Faith
in Christ comprises belief in Him, combined with trust in
Him. One cannot have faith without belief; yet he may
believe and still lack faith. Faith is vivified, vitalized, living
belief.</p>

<p><b>3.</b> Certainly there is a great difference in degree, even if
no essential distinction in kind be admitted between the
two. As shall be presently demonstrated, faith in the Godhead
is requisite to salvation; it is indeed a saving power,
leading its possessor in the paths of godliness; surely a mere
belief in the existence and attributes of Deity is no such
power. Mark the words of the Apostle James.<a name="FNanchor_268_268" id="FNanchor_268_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_268_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a> In his
general epistle to the Saints, he chided his brethren for
certain empty professions. Said he in effect:&mdash;You take
pride and satisfaction in declaring your belief in God; you
boast of being distinguished from the idolaters and the
heathen because you accept one God; you do well to so profess,
and so believe; but, remember, others do likewise;
even the devils believe; and so firmly that they tremble at
thought of the fate which that belief makes plain to them.&mdash;What,
do devils believe in Christ? Aye, their belief amounts
to certain knowledge, as to who He is, and as to what constitutes
His part, past, present, and to come, in the Divine
plan of human existence and salvation. Call to mind the
case of the man possessed by evil spirits, in the land of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
Gadarenes; a man so grievously tormented as to be a terror
to all who came near him; he could be neither tamed nor
bound; people were afraid to approach him; yet when he
saw Christ, he ran to Him and worshiped, and the wicked
spirit within him begged for mercy at the hands of that
Righteous One, calling Him "Jesus, Son of the Most High
God."<a name="FNanchor_269_269" id="FNanchor_269_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_269_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a> Again, an unclean spirit in the synagogue at Jerusalem
implored Christ not to use His power, crying in fear
and agony, "I know thee, who thou art, the Holy One of
God."<a name="FNanchor_270_270" id="FNanchor_270_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a> And then, we are told that Christ was once followed
by a multitude made up of people from Idumæa and Jerusalem,
from Tyre and Sidon; among them were many who were
possessed of evil spirits, and these, when they saw Him, fell
down in the attitude of worship, exclaiming: "Thou art
the Son of God."<a name="FNanchor_271_271" id="FNanchor_271_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_271_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a> Was there ever mortal believer who
confessed more unreservedly a knowledge of God and His
Son Jesus Christ than did these same followers of Satan?
The evil one knows God and Christ; remembers, perchance,
somewhat concerning the position which he once occupied
as a Son of the Morning<a name="FNanchor_272_272" id="FNanchor_272_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_272_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a>; yet with all such knowledge he is
Satan still. Neither belief nor its superior,&mdash;actual knowledge,&mdash;is
efficient to save; for neither of these is faith.
Belief may be a product of the mind, faith is of the heart;
belief is founded on reason; faith largely on intuition.</p>

<p><b>4.</b> We frequently hear it said that faith is imperfect
knowledge; that the first disappears as the second takes its
place; that now we walk by faith but some day we will walk
by the sure light of knowledge. In a sense this is true;
yet it must be remembered that knowledge may be as dead
and unproductive in good works as is faithless belief. Those
confessions of the devils, that Christ was the Son of God,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
were founded on knowledge; yet the great truth which they
knew did not change their evil natures. How different was
their acknowledgment of the Savior from that of Peter,
who, to the Master's question "Whom say ye that I am?"
replied in practically the words used by the unclean spirits
before cited, "Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living
God."<a name="FNanchor_273_273" id="FNanchor_273_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_273_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a> Peter's faith had already shown its vital power; it
had caused him to forsake much that had been dear, to
follow his Lord through persecution and suffering, and to
put away worldliness with all its fascinations, for the sacrificing
godliness which his faith made so desirable. His
knowledge of God as the Father, and of the Son as the
Redeemer, was perhaps no greater than that of the unclean
spirits; but while to them that knowledge was but an added
cause of condemnation, to him it was a means of salvation.</p>

<p><b>5.</b> The mere possession of knowledge gives no assurance
of benefit therefrom. An illustration may perhaps be here
allowed. During an epidemic of cholera in a large city, a
scientific man proved to his own satisfaction, by chemical
and microscopical tests, that the water supply was infected,
and that through it contagion was being spread. He proclaimed
the great truth throughout the city, and warned all
against the use of unboiled water. Many of the people,
although incapable of comprehending his methods of investigation,
far less of repeating such for themselves, had faith
in his warning words, followed his instructions, and escaped
the death to which their careless and unbelieving fellows
succumbed. Their faith was a saving one. To the man
himself, the truth by which so many lives had been spared
was a matter of knowledge. He had actually seen, under
the microscope, the death-dealing germs in the water; he
had tested their virulence; he knew of what he spoke.
Nevertheless, in a moment of forgetfulness he drank of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
unpurified water, and soon thereafter died a victim to the
plague. His knowledge did not save him, complete though
it was; yet others, whose reliance was only that of faith in
the truth which he declared, escaped the threatening destruction.
Truly he had knowledge; but, was he wise?
Knowledge is to wisdom what belief is to faith; one an
abstract principle, the other a living application. Not possession
merely, but the proper use of knowledge constitutes
wisdom. Of belief compared with faith it may be said, as
it has been taught of knowledge and wisdom:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="line">"Knowledge and wisdom, far from being one,</div>
<div class="line">Have oft-times no connection....</div>
<div class="line">Knowledge, a rude unprofitable mass,</div>
<div class="line">The mere material with which wisdom builds,</div>
<div class="line">Till smoothed and squared and fitted to its place,</div>
<div class="line">Does but encumber whom it seems to enrich."</div>
</div></div>

<p><b>6. The Foundation of Faith.</b>&mdash;In a theological sense, we
understand by faith as already outlined, a living, inspiring
confidence in God, and an acceptance of His will as our
law, and of His words as our guide, in life. Faith in God
is possible only as we come to know, or at least to believe,
that He exists, and moreover, that He is a Being of worthy
character and attributes. The grounds upon which man
founds his belief or knowledge respecting the existence of
God, have been examined in a previous lecture;<a name="FNanchor_274_274" id="FNanchor_274_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_274_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a> some of
the Divine attributes, as made known through God's dealings
with mankind, have been likewise specified. A restatement
of the principal facts relating to the character of
the Supreme Being may be in place here, inasmuch as some
knowledge concerning the attributes of Deity is essential to
the exercise of faith in Him. Let us adopt the summary of
facts as set forth by the prophet, Joseph Smith; he
presents, on the testimony of scripture, the following statements
respecting the character of God.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>
<p>"(1.) That He was God before the world was created,
and the same God that He was after it was created.</p>

<p>"(2.) That He is merciful and gracious, slow to anger,
abundant in goodness, and that He was so from everlasting,
and will be to everlasting.</p>

<p>"(3.) That He changes not, neither is there variableness
with Him; but that He is the same from everlasting to
everlasting, being the same yesterday, to-day, and for ever;
and that His course is one eternal round, without variation.</p>

<p>"(4.) That He is a God of truth and cannot lie.</p>

<p>"(5.) That He is no respecter of persons; but in every
nation he that fears God and works righteousness is accepted

<p><b>7.</b> A knowledge of these comprehensive features of the
Divine nature will enable one to exercise rational and intelligent
faith in God. And upon such knowledge of God's
existence, the worthiness of His character, and the perfection
of His attributes, is man's faith in Him established.
Faith then cannot be exercised in the absence of all
knowledge; yet even the benighted heathen show some of the
fruits of faith; but they have at least the conviction that
arises from man's natural intuition regarding a supreme
power, which has been described as a common heritage of
humanity. In every human soul, even in that of the
savage, there is some basis for faith, however limited and
imperfect the darkness of heredity or of wilful sin may have
made it. Every child of God is born with the capacity for
faith inherent within his own nature; and all yearn in some
degree for the strength and aid which only faith can give.

<p>The heathen's faith may be imperfect and weak, for his
ability to recognize the evidence upon which belief in God
depends may be small. While the first promptings of faith
toward God may be the result of natural intuition,&mdash;a faint
echo of the songs of praise which were so common during
the state of primeval childhood,&mdash;the later development will
be largely the result of unprejudiced and prayerful investigation
and search for truth.</p>

<p><b>8.</b> From trustworthy evidence, rightly interpreted, true
faith will spring; from false evidence, only distorted and
misplaced faith can arise.<a name="FNanchor_277_277" id="FNanchor_277_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_277_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a> Our conclusions concerning any
question under test will be governed largely by the number
and credibility of the witnesses, if it so be that we cannot
investigate the alleged facts for ourselves; and in either
case, by the amount and quality of the evidence obtainable.
Now, however improbable a declaration may appear to us, if
the truth of it be affirmed by witnesses in whom we have
confidence, we are led to admit the statement, at least provisionally,
as true. If many credible witnesses testify, and
moreover, if collateral evidence suggest itself through facts
in our possession, we may consider the statement as proved;
although we would be unable to affirm the truth of it on
the strength of our personal knowledge, until we had seen
and heard for ourselves, until in fact each of us had become
a competent witness through personal observation. To<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
illustrate: of the citizens of this country but a comparative
few perhaps have visited the seat of government; the masses
know nothing by actual observation of the Capitol, the
executive mansion, and other buildings of national interest
and importance; very few have personally met the President
who resides there. How does any one of the multitudes
who have not seen for themselves, know of the city of Washington,
of the Capitol, and of the President? Solely through
the testimony of others. He may have among his acquaintances
one or many who have been in the capital of our
country and whose statements he accepts as true; assuredly
he has heard or read of those who do know for themselves.
Then he hears of laws being framed there, and of
edicts issuing from the nation's headquarters; his studies
in school, his use of maps and books, and many other incidents
add to the evidence which soon becomes decisive.
His inferences multiply, and develop into a positive conviction.
He acquires a faith in the existence of a center of
national government, and a regard for the laws which
emanate therefrom.</p>

<p><b>9.</b> Let us take another illustration: Astronomers tell us
that the earth is of a kind with certain of the stars; that it
is one of a family of planets which revolve about the sun in
concentric orbits; and that some of those planets are many
times the size of our globe. We may not be skilled in
astronomers' methods of observation and calculation, and
may therefore be unable to test the truth of these statements
for ourselves; but we find such a mass of evidence resulting
from the united testimony of those in whose skill as scientific
workers we have confidence, that the conclusions are
accepted by us as fully proved.</p>

<p><b>10.</b> So too concerning the existence, authority, and attributes
of God, the testimonies of many holy men in ancient
and modern times,&mdash;prophets whose credibility is established<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
by the fulfillment of their predictions,&mdash;have come to us in
united declaration of the solemn truths, and nature furnishes
corroborative testimony on every side. To reject without
disproving such evidence is to ignore the most approved
methods of investigation and research known to man. The
development of faith from evidence is illustrated in the
scenes of a certain memorable Pentecost celebration, on
which occasion thousands of Jews, imbued with a preconceived
prejudice that Jesus was an impostor, heard the
apostles' testimonies, and witnessed the attendant signs:
three thousand of them were convinced of the truth and
became followers of the Son of God, their prejudice giving
place to belief, and their belief developing into faith with
its accompanying works.<a name="FNanchor_278_278" id="FNanchor_278_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_278_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a> The foundation of faith in God
then is a sincere belief in or knowledge of Him, as sustained
by evidence and testimony, tested and proved by
earnest, prayerful search.</p>

<p><b>11. Faith a Principle of Power.</b>&mdash;In its widest sense,
faith,&mdash;the assurance of things for which we hope, and the
evidence of things not discernible through our senses,&mdash;is the
motive principle that impels men to resolve and to act.
Without its exercise, we would make no exertion the results
of which are future: without faith that he may gather in
the autumn, man would not plant in the spring; neither
would he essay to build, did he not have confidence that he
would finish the structure and enjoy its use; had the student
no faith in the possibility of successfully following his
studies, he would not enter upon his courses. Faith thus
becomes to us the foundation of hope, from which spring
all our aspirations, ambitions, and confidences for the future.
Remove man's faith in the possibility of any desired success,
and you rob him of the incentive to strive. He would not
stretch forth his hand to seize did he not believe in the possibility<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
of securing that for which he reaches. This principle
becomes therefore the impelling force by which men struggle
for excellence, oftentimes enduring vicissitudes and suffering
that they may achieve their purposes. Faith is the secret of
ambition, the soul of heroism, the motive power of all effort.</p>

<p><b>12.</b> The exercise of faith is pleasing unto God, and
thereby His interposition may be secured. It was through
faith that the Israelites in their exodus from Egypt followed
their dauntless leader into the bed of the sea; and through
the protecting agencies of God, which that faith drew forth,
they were saved, while the Egyptians met destruction in
attempting to follow.<a name="FNanchor_279_279" id="FNanchor_279_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_279_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a> With full confidence in the instructions

<p><b>13.</b> But, it may be argued that faith of itself is not a
source of power; that its effect is due to an external interposition
of Divine aid, which faith merely secured; and the
skeptic may add that an omniscient God, if truly loving and
kind, would act independently and give without waiting to
be invoked through faith or prayer. A sufficient answer is
found in the abundant proof furnished by the scriptures,
that the Almighty operates in accordance with law; and that
arbitrary and capricious action is foreign to His nature.
However the laws of heaven may have been formulated, the
application of their beneficent provisions to humanity is
dependent on the faith and obedience of the mortal subjects.
Consider the defeat of Israel by the men of Ai; a law of
righteousness had been violated, and things that were
accursed had been introduced into the camp of God's people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
this transgression stopped the current of Divine help, and
until the people had sanctified themselves, the power was
not renewed unto them.<a name="FNanchor_298_298" id="FNanchor_298_298"></a><a href="#Footnote_298_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a> Christ was influenced, and to some
extent controlled in His miracles among men by the faith
or lack of faith of the people. The common benediction,
"Thy faith hath made thee whole," with which He announced
the healing interposition, is evidence of the fact.
Then we learn that in His own country He could do no
mighty work, being restrained by the unbelief of the people.<a name="FNanchor_299_299" id="FNanchor_299_299"></a><a href="#Footnote_299_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a></p>

<p><b>14. A Condition of Living Faith.</b>&mdash;A condition essential
to the exercise of a living, growing, sustaining faith in
Deity, is the consciousness on man's part that he is at least
endeavoring to live in accordance with the laws of God as he
has learned them. A knowledge that he is wilfully and
wantonly sinning against the truth will deprive him of sincerity
in prayer and faith, and will surely estrange him from
his Father. He must feel that the trend of his life's course is
acceptable to God, that with due allowance for mortal weakness
and human frailty he is in some measure approved of
the Lord, or he can never approach the throne of grace with
confidence. The consciousness of earnest effort toward
godly walk and conduct is a power of itself, strengthening
its possessor in sacrifice and under persecution, and sustaining
him in all good works. It was this knowledge of assured
communion with God that enabled the saints of olden time
to endure as they did, though their sufferings were appalling.
Of them we read that some "were tortured, not accepting
deliverance; that they might obtain a better resurrection:
And others had trial of cruel mockings and scourgings,
yea, moreover of bonds and imprisonment: They were
stoned, they were sawn asunder, were tempted, were slain
with the sword: they wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
being destitute, afflicted, tormented; (of whom the
world was not worthy:) they wandered in deserts, and in
mountains, and in dens and caves of the earth."<a name="FNanchor_300_300" id="FNanchor_300_300"></a><a href="#Footnote_300_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a> As in
former days so in the present, the saints have been sustained
through all their sufferings by the sure knowledge of Divine
approval; and the faith of righteous men has ever grown
through a consciousness of their good endeavors.</p>

<p><b>15. Faith Essential to Salvation.</b>&mdash;Inasmuch as salvation
is attainable only through the mediation and atonement
of Christ, and since this is made applicable to individual
sin only in the cases of those who obey the laws of
righteousness, faith in Jesus Christ is indispensable to salvation.
But no one can believe in Jesus Christ, and at the
same time doubt the existence and authority of either the
Father or the Holy Ghost; therefore faith in the entire
Godhead is essential to salvation. Paul declares that without
faith it is impossible to please God, "for he that cometh
to God must believe that He is, and that He is a rewarder of
them that diligently seek Him."<a name="FNanchor_301_301" id="FNanchor_301_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_301_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a> The scriptures abound
in assurances of salvation to those who exercise faith in God,
and obey the requirements which that faith makes plain.
Christ's words on the matter are conclusive, "He that believeth
and is baptized shall be saved, but he that believeth
not shall be damned;"<a name="FNanchor_302_302" id="FNanchor_302_302"></a><a href="#Footnote_302_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a> and again, "He that believeth on the
Son hath everlasting life, and he that believeth not the Son
shall not see life, but the wrath of God abideth on him."<a name="FNanchor_303_303" id="FNanchor_303_303"></a><a href="#Footnote_303_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a>
And similar doctrines did His apostles teach after His death
all the days of their ministry.<a name="FNanchor_304_304" id="FNanchor_304_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_304_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a> A natural result of implicit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
faith in the Godhead will be a growing confidence in the
scriptures as containing the word of God, and in the words
and works of His authorized servants, who speak as the
living oracles of heaven.</p>

<p><b>16. Faith a Gift of God.</b>&mdash;Though within the reach of
all who diligently strive to gain it, faith is nevertheless a
Divine gift, and can be obtained only from God.<a name="FNanchor_305_305" id="FNanchor_305_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_305_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a> As is
fitting for so priceless a pearl, it is given to those only who
show by their sincerity that they are worthy of it, and who
give promise of abiding by its dictates. Although faith is
called the first principle of the gospel of Christ, though it
be in fact the foundation of all religion, yet even faith is
preceded by sincerity of disposition and humility of soul,
whereby the word of God may make an impression upon the
heart.<a name="FNanchor_306_306" id="FNanchor_306_306"></a><a href="#Footnote_306_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a> No compulsion is used in bringing men to a knowledge
of God; yet, as fast as we open our hearts to the influences
of righteousness, the faith that leads to life eternal
will be given us of our Father.</p>

<p><b>17. Faith and Works.</b>&mdash;Faith in a passive sense, that is,
as mere belief, is inefficient as a means of salvation. This
truth was clearly set forth both by Christ and the apostles,
and the vigor with which it was declared may be an indication
of the early development of a most pernicious doctrine,&mdash;that
of justification by belief alone. The Savior
taught that works were essential to the validity of profession
and the efficacy of faith. Mark his words:&mdash;"Not every one
that sayeth unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom
of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father
which is in heaven."<a name="FNanchor_307_307" id="FNanchor_307_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_307_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a> "He that hath my commandments,
and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me: and he that
loveth me shall be loved of my Father, and I will love him, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
will manifest myself to him."<a name="FNanchor_308_308" id="FNanchor_308_308"></a><a href="#Footnote_308_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a> The instructions of the Apostle
James are particularly explicit:&mdash;"What doth it profit, my
brethren, though a man say he hath faith, and have not works?
can faith save him? If a brother or sister be naked, and destitute
of daily food, and one of you say unto them, depart in
peace, be ye warmed and filled; notwithstanding ye give
them not those things which are needful to the body; what
doth it profit? Even so faith, if it hath not works, is dead,
being alone. Yea, a man may say, Thou hast faith, and I
have works: shew me thy faith without thy works, and I
will shew thee my faith by my works."<a name="FNanchor_309_309" id="FNanchor_309_309"></a><a href="#Footnote_309_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a> And to this may
be added the words of John:&mdash;"And hereby we do know that
we know him, if we keep his commandments. He that
saith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is
a liar, and the truth is not in him. But whoso keepeth his
word, in him verily is the love of God perfected: hereby
know we that we are in him."<a name="FNanchor_310_310" id="FNanchor_310_310"></a><a href="#Footnote_310_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a></p>

<p><b>18.</b> To these teachings may be added many inspired utterances
from Nephite scriptures<a name="FNanchor_311_311" id="FNanchor_311_311"></a><a href="#Footnote_311_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a> and from modern revelation,<a name="FNanchor_312_312" id="FNanchor_312_312"></a><a href="#Footnote_312_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a>
all affirming the necessity of works, and denying the
saving efficacy of mere belief. Yet in spite of the plain
word of God, sectarian dogmas have been promulgated to the
effect that by faith alone man may achieve salvation, and
that a mere profession of belief shall open the doors of
heaven to the sinner.<a name="FNanchor_313_313" id="FNanchor_313_313"></a><a href="#Footnote_313_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a> The scriptures cited and man's
inherent sense of justice furnish a sufficient refutation of
these false teachings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>
<p class="center">REPENTANCE.</p>

<p><b>19. Nature of Repentance.</b>&mdash;The term repentance is used
in the scriptures with several different meanings, but, as
representing the duty required of all who would obtain forgiveness
for transgression, it indicates a godly sorrow for sin,
producing a reformation of life, and embodies (1) a conviction
of guilt; (2) a desire to escape the hurtful effects of
sin; and (3) an earnest determination to forsake sin and to
accomplish good. Repentance is a result of contrition of
soul, which springs from a deep sense of humility, and this
in turn is dependent upon the exercise of an abiding faith
in God. Repentance therefore properly ranks as the second
principle of the gospel, closely associated with and immediately
following faith. As soon as one has come to recognize
the existence and authority of God, he feels a respect for
Divine laws, and a conviction of his own unworthiness. His
wish to please the Father, whom he has so long neglected,
will impel him to forsake sin; and this impulse will acquire
added strength from the sinner's natural and commendable
desire to escape, if possible, the dire results of his own waywardness.
With the zeal inspired by fresh conviction, he
will crave an opportunity of showing by good works the sincerity
of his newly developed faith; and he will regard the
remission of his sins as the most desirable of blessings.
Then he will learn that this gift of mercy is granted on certain
specific conditions only.<a name="FNanchor_314_314" id="FNanchor_314_314"></a><a href="#Footnote_314_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a> The first step toward the
blessed state of forgiveness consists in the sinner confessing
his sins; the second, in his forgiving others who have sinned
against him; and the third in his showing his acceptance of
Christ's atoning sacrifice by obeying the Divine requirements.</p>

<p><b>20. (1.) Confession of Sins</b> is essential, for without it repentance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
is incomplete. The Apostle John tells us, "If we
say that we have no sin we deceive ourselves, and the truth
is not in us. If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just
to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness."<a name="FNanchor_315_315" id="FNanchor_315_315"></a><a href="#Footnote_315_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a>
We read also, "He that covereth his sins shall not
prosper, but whoso confesseth and forsaketh them shall
have mercy."<a name="FNanchor_316_316" id="FNanchor_316_316"></a><a href="#Footnote_316_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a> And unto the Saints in this dispensation the
Lord has said, "Verily I say unto you, I, the Lord, forgive
sins unto those who confess their sins before me and ask
forgiveness, who have not sinned unto death."<a name="FNanchor_317_317" id="FNanchor_317_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_317_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a> And that
this act of confession is included in repentance is shown by
the Lord's words: "By this ye may know if a man repenteth
of his sins: Behold he will confess them and forsake
them."<a name="FNanchor_318_318" id="FNanchor_318_318"></a><a href="#Footnote_318_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a></p>

<p><b>21. (2.) The Sinner Must be Willing to Forgive Others</b>, if
he hopes to obtain forgiveness. Surely his repentance is but
superficial if his heart be not softened to the degree of
tolerance for the weaknesses of his fellows. In teaching
His hearers how to pray, the Savior instructed them to
supplicate the Father: "Forgive us our debts as we forgive
our debtors."<a name="FNanchor_319_319" id="FNanchor_319_319"></a><a href="#Footnote_319_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a> He led them not to hope for forgiveness
if in their hearts they forgave not one another:
"For," said He, "if ye forgive men their trespasses, your
Heavenly Father will also forgive you; but if ye forgive
not men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive
your trespasses."<a name="FNanchor_320_320" id="FNanchor_320_320"></a><a href="#Footnote_320_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a> And forgiveness between man and man,
to be acceptable before the Lord, must be unbounded. In
answering Peter's question, "Lord, how oft shall my brother
sin against me, and I forgive him&mdash;till seven times?" the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
Master said, "I say not unto thee, until seven times; but
until seventy times seven;" clearly intending to teach that
man must ever be ready to forgive. On another occasion
He taught the disciples, saying, "If thy brother trespass
against thee, rebuke him, and if he repent, forgive him.
And if he trespass against thee seven times in a day, and
seven times in a day turn again to thee saying, I repent,
thou shalt forgive him."<a name="FNanchor_321_321" id="FNanchor_321_321"></a><a href="#Footnote_321_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a></p>

men the measure they mete unto their fellows,<a name="FNanchor_322_322" id="FNanchor_322_322"></a><a href="#Footnote_322_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a> the Savior
put forth to His disciples a parable of a king, to whom one
of his subjects owed an enormous sum of money, ten thousand
talents; but when the debtor humbled himself and
pleaded for mercy, the compassionate heart of the king was
moved and he forgave his servant the debt. But the same
servant, going out from the presence of the king, met a fellow-servant
who was indebted to him in a paltry sum; forgetting
the mercy so recently shown unto himself, he seized his
fellow-servant and cast him into prison till he would pay the
debt. Then the king, hearing of this, sent for the wicked
servant, and, denouncing him for his lack of gratitude and
consideration, handed him over to the tormentors.<a name="FNanchor_323_323" id="FNanchor_323_323"></a><a href="#Footnote_323_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a> The
Lord will not listen to petitions nor accept an offering from
one who has bitterness in his heart toward others; "First
be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy
gift."<a name="FNanchor_324_324" id="FNanchor_324_324"></a><a href="#Footnote_324_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a> In His revealed word to the Saints in this day, the
Lord has placed particular stress upon this necessary condition:
"Wherefore I say unto you that ye ought to forgive
one another, for he that forgiveth not his brother his trespasses,
standeth condemned before the Lord, for there remaineth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
in him the greater sin;"<a name="FNanchor_325_325" id="FNanchor_325_325"></a><a href="#Footnote_325_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a> and to remove all doubt
as to the proper subjects for human forgiveness, it is added:&mdash;"I,
the Lord, will forgive whom I will forgive, but of you
it is required to forgive all men."</p>

<p><b>23. (3.) Confidence in Christ's Atoning Sacrifice</b> constitutes
the third essential condition in obtaining remission of
sins. The name of Christ is the only name under heaven
whereby men may be saved;<a name="FNanchor_326_326" id="FNanchor_326_326"></a><a href="#Footnote_326_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a> and we are taught to offer our
petitions to the Father in the name of His Son. Adam
received this instruction from the mouth of an angel,<a name="FNanchor_327_327" id="FNanchor_327_327"></a><a href="#Footnote_327_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a> and
the Savior personally instructed the Nephites to the same
effect.<a name="FNanchor_328_328" id="FNanchor_328_328"></a><a href="#Footnote_328_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a> But no person can truthfully profess faith in
Christ, and refuse to obey His commandments; therefore
obedience is essential to remission of sin; and the repentant
sinner will eagerly seek to learn what is further required of
him.</p>

<p><b>24.</b> Repentance, to be worthy of its name, must comprise
something more than a mere self-acknowledgment of error;
it does not consist in lamentations and wordy confessions,
but in the heart-felt recognition of guilt, which carries with
it a horror for sin, and a resolute determination to make
amends for the past and to do better in the future. If such
a conviction be genuine, it is marked by that godly sorrow
which, as Paul has said, "worketh repentance to salvation,
not to be repented of; but the sorrow of the world worketh
death."<a name="FNanchor_329_329" id="FNanchor_329_329"></a><a href="#Footnote_329_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a> Apostle Orson Pratt has wisely said:&mdash;"It would
be of no use for a sinner to confess his sins to God, unless
he were determined to forsake them; it would be of no
benefit to him to feel sorry that he had done wrong, unless
he intended to do wrong no more; it would be folly for him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
to confess before God that he had injured his fellow-man,
unless he were determined to do all in his power to make restitution.
Repentance, then, is not only a confession of sins,
with a sorrowful, contrite heart, but a fixed, settled purpose
to refrain from every evil way."</p>

<p><b>25. Repentance Essential to Salvation.</b>&mdash;This evidence of
sincerity, this beginning of a better life, is required of
every candidate for salvation. In the obtaining of Divine
mercy, repentance is as indispensable as faith, it must be as
extensive as sin. Where can we find an absolutely sinless
mortal? Sagely did the Preacher of old declare "There is
not a just man upon earth, that doeth good and sinneth
not."<a name="FNanchor_330_330" id="FNanchor_330_330"></a><a href="#Footnote_330_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a> Who, therefore, has no need of forgiveness? who is
exempt from the requirements of repentance? God has
promised forgiveness unto those who truly repent before
Him, it is unto such that the advantages of individual
salvation, through the atonement of Christ, are extended.
Isaiah thus admonishes to repentance, with assuring promises
of forgiveness: "Seek ye the Lord while he may be found,
call ye upon him while he is near. Let the wicked forsake
his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts: and let
him return unto the Lord, and he will have mercy upon
him; and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon."<a name="FNanchor_331_331" id="FNanchor_331_331"></a><a href="#Footnote_331_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a></p>

<p><b>26.</b> The burden of inspired teachers in every age has
been the call to repentance. To this effect was heard the
voice of John crying in the wilderness, "Repent ye, for the
kingdom of heaven is at hand."<a name="FNanchor_332_332" id="FNanchor_332_332"></a><a href="#Footnote_332_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a> And the Savior followed
with "Repent ye and believe the gospel,"<a name="FNanchor_333_333" id="FNanchor_333_333"></a><a href="#Footnote_333_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a> for "Except ye
repent, ye shall all likewise perish."<a name="FNanchor_334_334" id="FNanchor_334_334"></a><a href="#Footnote_334_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a> So too proclaimed the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
apostles of old, that God "commandeth all men everywhere
to repent."<a name="FNanchor_335_335" id="FNanchor_335_335"></a><a href="#Footnote_335_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a> And in the present dispensation has come the
word, "We know that all men must repent, and believe on
the name of Jesus Christ ... or they cannot be
saved in the kingdom of God."<a name="FNanchor_336_336" id="FNanchor_336_336"></a><a href="#Footnote_336_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a></p>

<p><b>27. Repentance, a Gift from God.</b>&mdash;Repentance is a means
of pardon, and is therefore one of God's great gifts to man.
It is not to be had for the careless asking; it may not be
found upon the highway, it is not of earth, but a treasure
of heaven, and is given with care, yet with boundless liberality
unto those who have brought forth works that warrant
its bestowal.<a name="FNanchor_337_337" id="FNanchor_337_337"></a><a href="#Footnote_337_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a> That is to say, all who prepare themselves
for repentance will, by the humbling and softening influence
of the Holy Spirit, be led to the actual possession of
this great gift. When Peter was charged by his fellow-worshipers
with a breach of law in that he had associated
with Gentiles, he told his hearers of the Divine manifestations
he had so recently received; they believed and declared
"Then hath God also to the Gentiles granted repentance
unto life."<a name="FNanchor_338_338" id="FNanchor_338_338"></a><a href="#Footnote_338_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a> Paul also, in writing to the Romans,
teaches that repentance comes through the goodness of
God.<a name="FNanchor_339_339" id="FNanchor_339_339"></a><a href="#Footnote_339_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a></p>

<p><b>28. Repentance not always Possible.</b>&mdash;The gift of repentance
is extended to men as they humble themselves
before the Lord, it is the testimony of the Spirit in their
hearts; if they hearken not unto the monitor it will again
leave them, for the Spirit of God strives not ever with man.<a name="FNanchor_340_340" id="FNanchor_340_340"></a><a href="#Footnote_340_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a>
Repentance becomes more difficult as the sin is more wilful;
it is by humility and contrition of the heart that sinners<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
may increase their faith in God, and so obtain from Him
the priceless gift of repentance. As the time of repentance
is procrastinated, the ability to repent grows weaker;
neglect of opportunity in holy things brings a forfeit of the
chance. In giving commandment to Joseph Smith, in the
early days of the present Church, the Lord said, "For I
the Lord cannot look upon sin with the least degree of
allowance; nevertheless, he that repents and does the commandments
of the Lord shall be forgiven, and he that
repents not, from him shall be taken even the light which
he has received, for my Spirit shall not always strive with
man saith the Lord of Hosts."<a name="FNanchor_341_341" id="FNanchor_341_341"></a><a href="#Footnote_341_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a></p>

<p><b>29. Repentance Here and Hereafter.</b>&mdash;The Nephite
prophet, Alma, described the period of earthly existence as
a probationary state, granted unto man for repentance;<a name="FNanchor_342_342" id="FNanchor_342_342"></a><a href="#Footnote_342_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a> yet
we learn from the scriptures that repentance may be
obtained, under certain conditions, beyond the vail of
mortality. Between the times of His death and resurrection,
Christ "preached unto the spirits in prison, which
sometime were disobedient when once the long suffering of
God waited in the days of Noah;"<a name="FNanchor_343_343" id="FNanchor_343_343"></a><a href="#Footnote_343_343" class="fnanchor">[343]</a> these the Son visited,
and unto them He preached the Gospel, "that they might
be judged according to men in the flesh, who received not
the testimony of Jesus in the flesh, but afterwards received
it."<a name="FNanchor_344_344" id="FNanchor_344_344"></a><a href="#Footnote_344_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a></p>

<p><b>30.</b> Yet no soul is justified in postponing his efforts to
repent because of this assurance of God's long-suffering and
mercy. We know not on what terms repentance will be
obtainable in the hereafter, but it is unreasonable to suppose
that the soul who has wilfully rejected the opportunity
of repentance in this life will find it easy to repent there.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
To procrastinate<a name="FNanchor_345_345" id="FNanchor_345_345"></a><a href="#Footnote_345_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a> the day of repentance is to deliberately
place ourselves in the power of the adversary. As Amulek
taught and admonished the multitude of old: "For behold
this life is the time for men to prepare to meet God, ...
therefore I beseech of you that ye do not procrastinate the
day of your repentance unto the end.... Ye cannot
say when ye are brought to that awful crisis, that I will
repent, that I will return to my God. Nay, ye cannot say
this; for that same spirit which doth possess your bodies at
the time that ye go out of this life, that same spirit will
have power to possess your body in that eternal world. For
behold, if ye have procrastinated the day of your repentance,
even until death, behold ye have become subjected to the
spirit of the devil, and he doth seal you his."<a name="FNanchor_346_346" id="FNanchor_346_346"></a><a href="#Footnote_346_346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a></p>


<h4>NOTES.</h4>

<blockquote>

<p><b>1. Example of False Faith.</b>&mdash;"When Europeans first began their explorations
in the New World, the Indians whom they met were much amazed at the power and
explosive properties of gun-powder, and asked many questions respecting the manner in
which it was produced. The Europeans, taking advantage of the ignorance of the
savages, and seeing an opportunity to increase their wealth by the deception, told the
Indians that it was the seed of a plant which grew in the lands they had come from, and
doubtless it would thrive in their land also. The Indians, of course, believed this statement,
and purchased the supposed seed, giving in exchange for it large quantities of
gold. In implicit faith they carefully planted the supposed seed, and anxiously watched
for its sprouting and the appearance of the plant; but it never came. They had faith in
the statements made to them by the Europeans, but as these statements were false, and
therefore the evidence on which the Indians based their belief untrue, their faith was
vain."&mdash;Orson Pratt.</p>

<p><b>2. The Sectarian Dogma of Justification by Faith alone</b> has exercised
an influence for evil since the early days of Christianity. The idea upon which this pernicious
doctrine was founded was at first associated with that of an absolute predestination,
by which man was fore-doomed to destruction, or to an utterly undeserved salvation.
Thus, Luther taught as follows:&mdash;"The excellent, infallible, and sole preparation for
grace is the eternal election and predestination of God." "Since the fall of man, free-will
is but an idle word." "A man who imagines to arrive at grace by doing all that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
he is able to do, adds sin to sin, and is doubly guilty." "That man is not justified who
performs many works; but he who without works has much faith in Christ." (For these
and other doctrines of the so-called "Reformation," see D'Aubigné's <cite>History of the
Reformation</cite>, vol. i, pp. 82, 83, 119, 122.) In Miller's <cite>Church History</cite> (vol. iv, p. 514) we
read: "The point which the reformer [Luther] had most at heart in all his labors,
contests, and dangers, was the justification by faith alone." Melanchthon voices
the doctrine of Luther in these words: "Man's justification before God proceeds
from faith alone. This faith enters man's heart by the grace of God alone;" and
further, "As all things which happen, happen necessarily according to the divine
predestination, there is no such thing as liberty in our wills" (D'Aubigné, vol.
iii, p. 340). It is true that Luther strongly denounced, and vehemently disclaimed
responsibility for, the excesses to which this teaching gave rise, yet he was not less
vigorous in proclaiming the doctrine. Note his words:&mdash;"I, Doctor Martin Luther,
unworthy herald of the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ, confess this article, that faith
alone without works justifies before God; and I declare that it shall stand and remain
forever in despite of the emperor of the Romans, the emperor of the Turks, the emperor
of the Persians,&mdash;in spite of the pope and all the cardinals, with the bishops, priests,
monks, and nuns,&mdash;in spite of kings, princes, and nobles, and in spite of all the world
and of the devils themselves; and that if they endeavor to fight against this truth they
will draw the fires of hell upon their heads. This is the true and holy gospel, and the
declaration of me, Doctor Luther, according to the teachings of the Holy Ghost"
(D'Aubigné, vol. i, p. 70).</p>

<p>Fletcher (<cite>End of Religious Controversy</cite>, p. 90) illustrates the vicious extreme to which
this evil doctrine led, by accusing one of its adherents with having said, "Even
adultery and murder do not hurt the pleasant children, but rather work for their good.
God sees no sin in believers, whatever sin they may commit.... It is a most
pernicious error of the schoolmen to distinguish sins according to the fact, and not
according to the person. Though I blame those who say, let us sin that grace may
abound, yet adultery, incest, and murder, shall upon the whole, make me holier on earth,
and merrier in heaven."</p>

<p>A summary of the mediæval controversy regarding the means of grace, including the
doctrines of Luther and others, is presented in Roberts' <cite>Outlines of Ecclesiastical History</cite>,
part iii, section ii, to which the student is referred. The quotations given above are
incorporated therein.</p>

<p><b>3. Forgiveness not always Immediate.</b>&mdash;"On account of the magnitude of
sins committed, repentance is not always followed by forgiveness and restoration. For
instance, when Peter was preaching to the Jews, who had slain Jesus and taken His
blood on themselves and their children, he did not say, repent and be baptized for the
remission of sins; but, 'Repent ye therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be
blotted out, when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord; and
[when] He shall send Jesus Christ, which before was preached unto you; whom the
heaven must receive until the times of the restitution of all things' (Acts iii, 19-21).
That is, repent now, and believe in Jesus Christ, that you may be forgiven when He
whom you have slain shall come again in the days of the restitution of all things; and
prescribe to you the terms on which you may be saved."&mdash;<cite>Compendium</cite>, p. 28.</p></blockquote>

<h3>BAPTISM.</h3>

<blockquote>

<p><b>Article 4.</b>&mdash;We believe that the first principles and ordinances of the Gospel
are:&mdash;... (3) Baptism by immersion for the remission of sins; ...</p></blockquote>


<p><b>1. Nature of Baptism.</b>&mdash;Among the Latter-day Saints,
water baptism ranks as the third principle, and the first
essential ordinance, of the gospel. Baptism is the gateway
leading into the fold of Christ, the portal to the Church,
the established rite of naturalization in the kingdom of
God. The candidate for admission into the Church and
kingdom, having obtained and professed faith in the Lord
Jesus Christ, and having sincerely repented of his sins, is
properly required to give evidence of this spiritual sanctification
by some outward ordinance, prescribed by authority as
the sign or symbol of the new profession. The initiatory
ordinance is baptism by water, to be followed by the higher
baptism of the Holy Spirit; and, as a result of this act of
obedience, remission of sins is granted.</p>

<p><b>2.</b> How simple are the means thus ordained for admission
into the fold; they are within the reach of the poorest and
weakest, as also of the rich and powerful! What symbol
more expressive of a cleansing from sin could be given, than
that of baptism in water? Baptism is made a sign of the
covenant entered into between the repentant sinner and his
Maker, that thereafter he will seek to observe the Divine
commands. Concerning this fact, the Prophet Alma thus
admonished and instructed the people of Gideon:&mdash;"Yea, I
say unto you, come and fear not, and lay aside every sin,
which easily doth beset you, which doth bind you down to
destruction, yea, come and go forth, and show unto your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
God that ye are willing to repent of your sins, and enter
into a covenant with him to keep his commandments, and
witness it unto him this day, by going into the waters of
baptism."<a name="FNanchor_347_347" id="FNanchor_347_347"></a><a href="#Footnote_347_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a></p>

<p><b>3.</b> The humbled sinner, convicted of his transgression,
through the bestowal of God's good gifts of faith and
repentance, will hail most joyfully any means of cleansing
himself from pollution, now so repulsive in his eyes; all
such will cry out as did the stricken Jewish multitude at
Pentecost, "What shall we do?" Unto such comes the
answering voice of the Spirit, through the medium of
scripture, or by the mouths of the Lord's appointed servants,
"Repent and be baptized every one of you in the
name of Jesus Christ, for the remission of sins."<a name="FNanchor_348_348" id="FNanchor_348_348"></a><a href="#Footnote_348_348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a> Springing
forth as a result of contrition of soul, baptism has been very
appropriately called the first fruits of repentance.<a name="FNanchor_349_349" id="FNanchor_349_349"></a><a href="#Footnote_349_349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a></p>

<p><b>4. The Establishment of Baptism</b> dates from the time of
the earliest history of the race. When the Lord manifested
Himself to Adam after the expulsion from the Garden of
Eden, He promised the patriarch of the race, "If thou wilt
turn unto me and hearken unto my voice, and believe, and
repent of all thy transgressions, and be baptized, even in
water, in the name of mine Only Begotten Son, who is full
of grace and truth, which is Jesus Christ, the only name
which shall be given under heaven, whereby salvation shall
come unto the children of men, ye shall receive the gift
of the Holy Ghost, asking all things in His name, and whatsoever
ye shall ask, it shall be given you.... And
it came to pass, when the Lord had spoken with Adam, our
father, that Adam cried unto the Lord, and he was caught
away by the Spirit of the Lord, and was carried down into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
the water, and was laid under the water, and was brought
forth out of the water. And thus he was baptized, and the
Spirit of God descended upon him, and thus he was born of
the Spirit, and became quickened in the inner man."[350] Enoch
preached the doctrine of repentance and baptism, and did
baptize the people, and as many as accepted these teachings
and submitted to the requirements of the gospel, became
sanctified and holy in the sight of God.</p>

<p><b>5. The Special Purpose of Baptism</b> is to afford admission
to the Church of Christ with remission of sins. What need
of more words to prove the worth of this divinely appointed
ordinance? What gift could be offered the human
race greater than a ready means of obtaining forgiveness for
transgression? Justice forbids the granting of universal
and unconditional pardon for sins committed, except through
obedience to ordained law; but means simple and effective
are provided, whereby the penitent sinner may enter into a
covenant with God, sealing that covenant with the sign that
commands recognition in heaven, that he will submit himself
to the laws of God; thus he places himself within the
reach of Mercy, under whose protecting influence he may
win eternal life.</p>

<p><b>6.</b> <em>Biblical Proofs</em>, that baptism is designed as a means
of securing to man a remission of his sins, are abundant.
John the Baptist was the special preacher of this doctrine
in the days immediately preceding the Savior's ministry in
the flesh; and the voice of this priest of the desert stirred
Jerusalem and reverberated through all Judæa, proclaiming
remission of sins as the fruits of acceptable baptism.<a name="FNanchor_351_351" id="FNanchor_351_351"></a><a href="#Footnote_351_351" class="fnanchor">[351]</a></p>

<p><b>7.</b> Saul of Tarsus, a zealous persecutor of the followers
of Christ, while journeying to Damascus, intent on a further
exercise of his ill-directed zeal, received a special manifestation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
of the power of God, and was converted with signs and
wonders. He heard and answered the voice of Christ, and
thus became a special witness of his Lord. Yet even this
unusual demonstration of Divine favor was insufficient.
Blinded through the glory that had been manifested unto
him, humbled and earnest, awakening to the terrible fact
that he had been persecuting his Redeemer, he exclaimed in
anguish of soul, "What shall I do, Lord?" He was directed
to go to Damascus, there to learn more of God's will concerning
him. Gladly did he receive the Lord's messenger,
devout Ananias, who ministered unto him so that he regained
his sight, and then taught him baptism as a means
of obtaining forgiveness.<a name="FNanchor_352_352" id="FNanchor_352_352"></a><a href="#Footnote_352_352" class="fnanchor">[352]</a></p>

<p><b>8.</b> And Saul, known now as Paul, thereafter a preacher
of righteousness, and an apostle of the Lord Jesus Christ,
taught to others the same great saving principle, that by
baptism in water comes regeneration from sin.<a name="FNanchor_353_353" id="FNanchor_353_353"></a><a href="#Footnote_353_353" class="fnanchor">[353]</a> In forceful
language, and attended with special evidences of Divine
power, Peter declared the same doctrine to the penitent
multitude. Overcome with grief at the recital of what
they had done to the Son of God, they cried out "Men and
brethren, what shall we do?" Promptly came the answer,
with apostolic authority, "Repent, and be baptized every
one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of
sins."<a name="FNanchor_354_354" id="FNanchor_354_354"></a><a href="#Footnote_354_354" class="fnanchor">[354]</a></p>

<p><b>9.</b> <em>Book of Mormon prophets</em> gave the same testimony to
the western fold of Christ. To this effect were the words
of Nephi, the son of Lehi, addressed to his brethren:&mdash;"For
the gate by which ye should enter, is repentance, and
baptism by water; and then cometh a remission of your
sins by fire, and by the Holy Ghost."<a name="FNanchor_355_355" id="FNanchor_355_355"></a><a href="#Footnote_355_355" class="fnanchor">[355]</a> So did Alma teach<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>

advent upon earth, went forth amongst his people, baptizing
unto repentance, from which followed "a great remission
of sins."<a name="FNanchor_357_357" id="FNanchor_357_357"></a><a href="#Footnote_357_357" class="fnanchor">[357]</a> Nephi ordained assistants in the ministry,

before God, and unto the people, that they had repented
and received a remission of their sins."<a name="FNanchor_358_358" id="FNanchor_358_358"></a><a href="#Footnote_358_358" class="fnanchor">[358]</a> Mormon adds his
own testimony, as commissioned of Christ, exhorting the
people to forsake their sins and be baptized for remission
thereof.<a name="FNanchor_359_359" id="FNanchor_359_359"></a><a href="#Footnote_359_359" class="fnanchor">[359]</a></p>

<p><b>10.</b> <em>Modern Revelation</em>, concerning baptism and its object,
shows that the same importance is ascribed by the Lord to
the ordinance today as in earlier times. That there may
be no question as to the application of this doctrine to the
Church in the present dispensation, the principle has been
re-stated, the law has been re-enacted for our guidance.
The elders of the Church are commissioned to preach the
remission of sins as obtainable through the means of authorized
baptism.<a name="FNanchor_360_360" id="FNanchor_360_360"></a><a href="#Footnote_360_360" class="fnanchor">[360]</a></p>

<p><b>11. Fit Candidates for Baptism.</b>&mdash;The prime object of
baptism being admission to the Church, with remission of
sins, and this coming only through the exercise of faith in
God and true repentance before Him, it naturally follows
that baptism can in justice be required of those only who are
capable of exercising faith and of working repentance.<a name="FNanchor_361_361" id="FNanchor_361_361"></a><a href="#Footnote_361_361" class="fnanchor">[361]</a> In
a revelation on Church government given through Joseph the
Prophet, April, 1830, the Lord specifically states the conditions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
under which persons may be received into the Church
through baptism: these are His words:&mdash;"All those who
humble themselves before God, and desire to be baptized,
and come forth with broken hearts and contrite spirits, and
witness before the Church that they have truly repented of
all their sins, and are willing to take upon them the name of
Jesus Christ, having a determination to serve him to the end,
and truly manifest by their works that they have received of
the Spirit of Christ unto the remission of their sins, shall be
received by baptism into his Church."<a name="FNanchor_362_362" id="FNanchor_362_362"></a><a href="#Footnote_362_362" class="fnanchor">[362]</a></p>

<p><b>12.</b> Such conditions exclude all who have not arrived at
the age of discretion and responsibility; and by special commandment
the Lord has forbidden the Church to receive any
who have not attained to such age.<a name="FNanchor_363_363" id="FNanchor_363_363"></a><a href="#Footnote_363_363" class="fnanchor">[363]</a> By revelation, the
Lord has designated eight years as the age at which children
may be properly baptized into the Church, and parents are
required to prepare their children for the ordinances of the
Church, by teaching them the doctrines of faith, repentance,
baptism, and the gift of the Holy Ghost. Failure in this
requirement is accounted by the Lord as a sin resting upon
the heads of the parents.<a name="FNanchor_364_364" id="FNanchor_364_364"></a><a href="#Footnote_364_364" class="fnanchor">[364]</a></p>

<p><b>13. Infant Baptism.</b>&mdash;The Latter-day Saints are opposed
to the practice of infant baptism, which indeed they believe
to be sacrilege in the eyes of God. No one having faith in
the word of God can look upon the child as impure; such an
innocent being needs no initiation into the fold, for it has
never strayed therefrom; it needs no remission of sins, for it
is sinless; and should it die before it has become contaminated
by the sins of earth, it will be received again, without
baptism, into the presence of its God. Yet there are many
professedly Christian teachers who declare that as all children<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
are born into a wicked world, they are themselves wicked,
and must be cleansed in the waters of baptism to be made
acceptable to God. How heinous is such a doctrine!&mdash;the
child to whom the Savior pointed as an example of emulation
of those even who had received the holy apostleship,<a name="FNanchor_365_365" id="FNanchor_365_365"></a><a href="#Footnote_365_365" class="fnanchor">[365]</a> the
Lord's selected type of the kingdom of heaven, the favored
spirits whose angels stand forever in the presence of the
Father, faithfully reporting all that may be done unto
their sacred charges<a name="FNanchor_366_366" id="FNanchor_366_366"></a><a href="#Footnote_366_366" class="fnanchor">[366]</a>&mdash;such souls are to be rejected and cast
into torment because their earthly guardians failed to have
them baptized! To teach such a doctrine is sin.</p>

<p><b>14. The History of Infant Baptism</b> is instructive, as throwing
light upon the origin of this erratic practice. It is
certain that the baptism of infants, or pedobaptism (Greek
<i lang="el" xml:lang="el">paidos</i>, child, and <i lang="el" xml:lang="el">baptismos</i>, baptism) as it is styled in
theological lore, was not taught by the Savior, nor by His
apostles. Some point to the incident of Christ blessing
little children, and rebuking those who would forbid the
little ones coming unto Him,<a name="FNanchor_367_367" id="FNanchor_367_367"></a><a href="#Footnote_367_367" class="fnanchor">[367]</a> as an evidence in favor of
infant baptism; but, as has been wisely and tersely remarked:&mdash;"From
the action of Christ's blessing infants, to
infer they are to be baptized, proves nothing so much as
that there is a want of better argument; for the conclusion
would with more probability be derived thus: Christ blessed
infants, and so dismissed them, but baptized them not;
therefore infants are not to be baptized."</p>

<p><b>15.</b> There is no authentic record of infant baptism having
been practiced during the first two centuries after
Christ, and the custom probably did not become general till
the fifth century; from the last-named time until the
Reformation, however, it was accepted by the dominant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
church organization. But even during that dark age,
many theological disputants raised their voices against this
unholy rite.<a name="FNanchor_368_368" id="FNanchor_368_368"></a><a href="#Footnote_368_368" class="fnanchor">[368]</a> In the early part of the sixteenth century, a
sect rose into prominence in Germany, under the name of
Anabaptists (Greek <i lang="el" xml:lang="el">ana</i>, again, and <i lang="el" xml:lang="el">baptizo</i>, baptize), distinguished
for its opposition to the practice of infant baptism,
and deriving its name from the requirement made of
all its members who had been baptized in infancy that they
be baptized again. This denomination, commonly called the
Baptists, has become greatly divided by internal disputes;
but in general, the Baptists have maintained a unity of
belief in opposing the baptism of irresponsible children.</p>

<p><b>16.</b> Some pedobaptists have attempted to prove an
analogy between baptism and circumcision; but for such
position there is no scriptural warrant. Circumcision was
made the mark of a covenant between God and His chosen
servant Abraham,<a name="FNanchor_369_369" id="FNanchor_369_369"></a><a href="#Footnote_369_369" class="fnanchor">[369]</a> a symbol regarded by the posterity of
Abraham as indicative of their freedom from the idolatry
of the times, and of God's acceptance of them; and nowhere
is circumcision made a means for remission of sins. That
rite was applicable to males only; baptism is administered
to both sexes. Circumcision was to be performed on the
eighth day after birth, even though such should fall on the
Sabbath.<a name="FNanchor_370_370" id="FNanchor_370_370"></a><a href="#Footnote_370_370" class="fnanchor">[370]</a> In the third century a council of bishops was
held under the presidency of Cyprian, Bishop of Carthage,
at which it was gravely determined, that to postpone
baptism until the eighth day after birth was dangerous,
and consequently not to be allowed.</p>

<p><b>17. Infant Baptism is Forbidden in the Book of Mormon</b>,
from which fact we know that disputation upon this subject
must have arisen among the Nephites. Mormon, having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
received special revelation from the Lord concerning the
matter, wrote an epistle thereon to his son Moroni, in which
he denounces the practice of infant baptism, and declares
that any one who supposeth that little children need baptism
is in the gall of bitterness, and in the bonds of iniquity,
denying the mercies of Christ, and setting at naught His
atonement and the power of His redemption.<a name="FNanchor_371_371" id="FNanchor_371_371"></a><a href="#Footnote_371_371" class="fnanchor">[371]</a></p>

<p><b>18. Baptism Essential to Salvation.</b>&mdash;Most of the proofs
concerning the object of baptism apply with equal force
to the proposition that baptism is necessary for salvation;
for, inasmuch as remission of sins constitutes a special purpose
of baptism, and as no soul can be saved in the kingdom
of God with unforgiven sins, it is plain that baptism
is essential to salvation. Salvation is promised to man on
condition of his obedience to the commands of God; and,
as the scriptures conclusively prove, baptism is one of the
most important of such requirements. Baptism, being commanded
of God, must be essential to the purpose for which
it is instituted, for our Father deals not with unnecessary
forms. Baptism is required of all who have attained to
years of accountability; none are exempt.</p>

<p><b>19.</b> Even Christ, standing as a man without sin in the
midst of a sinful world, was baptized, "to fulfill all righteousness,"<a name="FNanchor_372_372" id="FNanchor_372_372"></a><a href="#Footnote_372_372" class="fnanchor">[372]</a>
such being the purpose, as declared by the
Savior Himself to the hesitating priest, who, zealous as he
was for his great mission, yet demurred when asked to baptize
One whom he considered sinless. Centuries before the
great event, Nephi, prophesying among the people in the
western world, fore-told the baptism of the Savior, and beautifully
explained how righteousness would be thereby fulfilled:<a name="FNanchor_373_373" id="FNanchor_373_373"></a><a href="#Footnote_373_373" class="fnanchor">[373]</a>&mdash;"And
now if the Lamb of God, he being holy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
should have need to be baptized by water to fulfill all righteousness,
O, then, how much more need have we, being
unholy, to be baptized?"</p>

<p><b>20.</b> The words of the Savior, spoken while He ministered
in the flesh, declare baptism to be essential to salvation.
One of the rulers of the Jews, Nicodemus, came to Christ by
night and made a profession of confidence in the instructions
of the Savior, whom he designated as "a teacher come
from God." Seeing his faith, Jesus taught unto him one of
the chief laws of heaven, saying: "Except a man be born
again, he cannot see the kingdom of God." A question by
Nicodemus called forth from the Savior the additional declaration,
"Verily, verily I say unto thee, except a man be born
of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom
of God."<a name="FNanchor_374_374" id="FNanchor_374_374"></a><a href="#Footnote_374_374" class="fnanchor">[374]</a> It is practically indisputable, that the watery
birth here referred to as essential to entrance into the kingdom
is baptism. We learn further, concerning Christ's
attitude toward baptism, that He required the ordinance of
those who professed to become His disciples.<a name="FNanchor_375_375" id="FNanchor_375_375"></a><a href="#Footnote_375_375" class="fnanchor">[375]</a> When appearing
to the Eleven in His resurrected state, giving them His
farewell blessing and final commission, He commanded them:
"Go ye, therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in
the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy
Ghost;"<a name="FNanchor_376_376" id="FNanchor_376_376"></a><a href="#Footnote_376_376" class="fnanchor">[376]</a> and, concerning the results of baptism, He taught
them, that "He that believeth and is baptized shall be
saved, but he that believeth not shall be damned."<a name="FNanchor_377_377" id="FNanchor_377_377"></a><a href="#Footnote_377_377" class="fnanchor">[377]</a></p>

<p><b>21.</b> Plain as seems the spirit of these instructions and
promises, there are nevertheless many who, while professing
to teach the doctrine of the Redeemer, evade the meaning
of His precepts, and declare that because He said "he that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
believeth not shall be damned," instead of "he that is not
baptized shall be damned," baptism is after all not an essential,
but a mere convenience or simple propriety, in the plan
of salvation. It is a mockery of faith to profess belief in
Christ while refusing to abide by His commandments. To
believe the word of God and do it not, is to increase our
culpability; such a course but adds hypocrisy to other sin.
Surely the full penalty provided for wilful unbelief will
fall to the lot of the professed believer who refuses to yield
obedience to the very principles in which he boasts of
having faith. And what can be said of the sincerity of
one who refuses to obey the Divine commands except there
be specific penalties provided for disobedience? Can such
a one's repentance be sincere, when he now is submissive
only through fear of punishment? However, in stating
this principle for the government of the Saints in the present
dispensation, the Lord's words are more particular and
specific, "And he that believeth and is baptized shall be
saved, and he that believeth not, and is not baptized, shall
be damned."<a name="FNanchor_378_378" id="FNanchor_378_378"></a><a href="#Footnote_378_378" class="fnanchor">[378]</a></p>

<p><b>22.</b> The same doctrine concerning the necessity of baptism
was preached by the disciples of Christ, particularly
those who were immediately associated with Him in the ministry.
John the Baptist testifies that he had been appointed
to baptize with water,<a name="FNanchor_379_379" id="FNanchor_379_379"></a><a href="#Footnote_379_379" class="fnanchor">[379]</a> and, concerning those who accepted
John's teachings, the Savior declared that they, even though
they were publicans, justified God, while the Pharisees and
lawyers who refused to be baptized, "rejected the counsels
of God against themselves,"<a name="FNanchor_380_380" id="FNanchor_380_380"></a><a href="#Footnote_380_380" class="fnanchor">[380]</a> thereby, most assuredly forfeiting
their claim to salvation. As already pointed out, Peter,
the chief of the apostles, had but one answer to give to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
eager multitude seeking to know the essentials of salvation,
"Repent and be baptized, every one of you."<a name="FNanchor_381_381" id="FNanchor_381_381"></a><a href="#Footnote_381_381" class="fnanchor">[381]</a></p>

<p><b>23.</b> Christ's humble compliance with the will of His
Father, by submitting to baptism even though He stood
sinless, surely declares to the world in language more forceful
than words that none are exempt from this condition,
that baptism indeed is a requisite for salvation. So, no evidence
of Divine favor, no bestowal of heavenly gifts, excuses
man from obedience to this and other requirements of the
gospel. Some illustrations of this fact have been given in
connection with the purpose of baptism. Saul of Tarsus,
though permitted to hear the voice of His Redeemer, could
only enter the Church of Christ through the portals of baptism
by water and by the Holy Ghost.<a name="FNanchor_382_382" id="FNanchor_382_382"></a><a href="#Footnote_382_382" class="fnanchor">[382]</a> Afterward he
preached baptism, declaring that by that ordinance may "we
put on Christ," becoming the children of God. Cornelius,
the centurion, was acknowledged of God through prayers and
alms, and an angel came to him, and instructed him to send
for Peter, who would tell him what to do. The apostle, having
been specially prepared by the Lord for this mission, entered
the house of the penitent Gentile, though to do such,
was to violate the customs of the Jews; and taught him and
his family of Christ Jesus. Even while Peter was speaking,
the Holy Ghost fell upon his hearers, so that they testified
by the gift of tongues, and greatly glorified God.<a name="FNanchor_383_383" id="FNanchor_383_383"></a><a href="#Footnote_383_383" class="fnanchor">[383]</a> Yet
the bestowal of such great gifts in no degree exempted
them from compliance with the law of baptism; and
Peter commanded them to be baptized in the name of the
Lord.</p>

<p><b>24.</b> Christ's ministers on the western continent were not
less energetic in promulgating the doctrine of baptism.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
Lehi<a name="FNanchor_384_384" id="FNanchor_384_384"></a><a href="#Footnote_384_384" class="fnanchor">[384]</a> and his son Nephi,<a name="FNanchor_385_385" id="FNanchor_385_385"></a><a href="#Footnote_385_385" class="fnanchor">[385]</a> each testified of the baptism of
the Savior, and of the absolute necessity of baptism by water
and by the Holy Ghost on the part of all seekers after salvation.
Nephi beautifully compares repentance and baptism
by water and the Spirit to the gate leading into the fold of
Christ.<a name="FNanchor_386_386" id="FNanchor_386_386"></a><a href="#Footnote_386_386" class="fnanchor">[386]</a> Alma the first preached baptism as indispensable
to salvation, calling upon the people to witness unto the
Lord by their observance of this principle, that they covenanted
to keep His commandments. The second Alma, son
of the former, proclaimed baptism as a means of salvation,
and consecrated ministers to baptize.<a name="FNanchor_387_387" id="FNanchor_387_387"></a><a href="#Footnote_387_387" class="fnanchor">[387]</a></p>

<p><b>25.</b> During the last century preceding the birth of
Christ, the work of God among the Lamanites was begun,
by the preaching of faith, repentance, and baptism; Ammon
declared this doctrine to King Lamoni and his people.<a name="FNanchor_388_388" id="FNanchor_388_388"></a><a href="#Footnote_388_388" class="fnanchor">[388]</a>
Helaman preached baptism;<a name="FNanchor_389_389" id="FNanchor_389_389"></a><a href="#Footnote_389_389" class="fnanchor">[389]</a> and in the time of his ministry,
less than half a century before Christ's advent on earth, we
read that tens of thousands united themselves with the
Church, by baptism. So also preached Helaman's sons,<a name="FNanchor_390_390" id="FNanchor_390_390"></a><a href="#Footnote_390_390" class="fnanchor">[390]</a> and
his grandson Nephi.<a name="FNanchor_391_391" id="FNanchor_391_391"></a><a href="#Footnote_391_391" class="fnanchor">[391]</a> These baptisms were performed in
the name of the Messiah who was to come; but when He
came to His western flock, He directed that they should be
baptized in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and
of the Holy Ghost; and bestowed upon twelve chosen servants
the authority to officiate in the ordinance,<a name="FNanchor_392_392" id="FNanchor_392_392"></a><a href="#Footnote_392_392" class="fnanchor">[392]</a> promising
the riches of Heaven unto all who would comply with His
law, and unto such only.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p><b>26.</b> Evidence is abundant that the Savior regarded the
baptized state as an essential condition of membership in
His Church; thus, when instituting the sacrament among
the Nephites, He instructed His disciples to administer it
unto those only who had been properly baptized.<a name="FNanchor_393_393" id="FNanchor_393_393"></a><a href="#Footnote_393_393" class="fnanchor">[393]</a> Further,
we are informed that those who were baptized as Jesus had
directed, were called the Church of Christ.<a name="FNanchor_394_394" id="FNanchor_394_394"></a><a href="#Footnote_394_394" class="fnanchor">[394]</a> True to the
Savior's promise, the Holy Ghost came to those who were
baptized by His ordained authority, thus adding to water-baptism
the higher baptism of fire and the Holy Ghost;<a name="FNanchor_395_395" id="FNanchor_395_395"></a><a href="#Footnote_395_395" class="fnanchor">[395]</a> and
many of them received wonderful manifestations of the
Divine approval, seeing and hearing unspeakable things,
not lawful to be written. The faith of the people showed
itself in good works,<a name="FNanchor_396_396" id="FNanchor_396_396"></a><a href="#Footnote_396_396" class="fnanchor">[396]</a> in prayers and fasting,<a name="FNanchor_397_397" id="FNanchor_397_397"></a><a href="#Footnote_397_397" class="fnanchor">[397]</a> in acknowledgment
of which Christ reappeared, this time manifesting
Himself to the Disciples whom He had called to the ministry;
and unto them he reiterated the former promises regarding
all who were baptized of Him; and to this He added, that,
provided they endured to the end, they should be held
guiltless in the day of judgment.<a name="FNanchor_398_398" id="FNanchor_398_398"></a><a href="#Footnote_398_398" class="fnanchor">[398]</a> On that occasion, He
repeated the commandment through obedience to which
salvation is promised:&mdash;"Repent all ye ends of the earth,
and come unto me, and be baptized in my name, that ye
may be sanctified by the reception of the Holy Ghost, that
ye may stand spotless before me at the last day."<a name="FNanchor_399_399" id="FNanchor_399_399"></a><a href="#Footnote_399_399" class="fnanchor">[399]</a></p>

<p><b>27.</b> Nearly four centuries later, we hear the same proclamation
from the lips of Mormon.<a name="FNanchor_400_400" id="FNanchor_400_400"></a><a href="#Footnote_400_400" class="fnanchor">[400]</a> And Moroni, his son,
the solitary representative of a once mighty people, while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>

truth of this doctrine;<a name="FNanchor_401_401" id="FNanchor_401_401"></a><a href="#Footnote_401_401" class="fnanchor">[401]</a> then being spared contrary to his
expectations, he reverts again to the sacred theme, realizing
the incalculable worth of the doctrine unto any and all who
would read his pages; and in what might be regarded as his
last words, he testifies to baptism by water and the Spirit as
the means of salvation.<a name="FNanchor_402_402" id="FNanchor_402_402"></a><a href="#Footnote_402_402" class="fnanchor">[402]</a></p>

<p><b>28.</b> And this great principle, proclaimed of old, remains
unaltered today; it is truth and changes not. The elders
of the Church today have been commissioned in almost the
same words as were used in authorizing the apostles of old:&mdash;"Go
ye into all the world, preach the gospel to every
creature, acting in the authority which I have given you,
baptizing in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of
the Holy Ghost; and he that believeth and is baptized shall

again, hear the word of the Lord through Joseph the
Prophet unto the elders of the Church:&mdash;"Therefore, as I
said unto mine apostles I say unto you again, that every
soul who believeth on your words, and is baptized by water
for the remission of sins shall receive the Holy Ghost." But,
"verily, verily I say unto you, they who believe not on your
words, and are not baptized in water, in my name, for the
remission of their sins, that they may receive the Holy
Ghost, shall be damned, and shall not come into my Father's
kingdom where my Father and I am."<a name="FNanchor_404_404" id="FNanchor_404_404"></a><a href="#Footnote_404_404" class="fnanchor">[404]</a> In obedience to
these commands, the elders of this Church have continued
to proclaim the gospel among the nations, preaching faith,
repentance, and baptism by water and the Holy Ghost, as
essential to salvation.</p>

<p><b>29.</b> We have examined the doctrines concerning baptism
current among the Jews, the Nephites, and the Church of
Jesus Christ in this age, and have found the principles
taught to be ever the same. Indeed, we have gone farther
back, even to the earliest history of the human race, and
have learned that baptism was announced as a saving principle
by which Adam was promised forgiveness and salvation.
No one has reason to hope for salvation except by complying
with the law of God, of which baptism is an essential
part.</p>


<h3>NOTES.</h3>

<blockquote>

<p><b>1. Preparation for Baptism.</b>&mdash;The doctrine that baptism, to be acceptable,
must be preceded by efficient preparation, was generally taught and understood in the
days of Christ, as also in the so-called apostolic period, and the time immediately following.
But this belief gradually fell away, and baptism came to be regarded as an
outward form, the application of which depended little, if at all, on the candidates' appreciation,
or conception of its purpose; and, as stated in the test, the Lord deemed it
wise to re-announce the doctrine in the present dispensation. Concerning the former
belief a few evidences are here given:</p>

<p>"In the first ages of Christianity, men and women were baptized on a profession of
faith in the Lord Jesus Christ."&mdash;<cite>Canon Farrar.</cite></p>

<p>"But as Christ enjoins them (Mark, xvi, 15-16) to teach before baptizing, and desires
that none but believers shall be admitted to baptism, it would appear that baptism is not
properly administered unless when it is preceded by faith."... In the apostolic
age "no one is found to have been admitted to baptism without a previous profession of
faith and repentance."&mdash;<cite>Calvin.</cite></p>

<p>"You are not first baptized, and then begin to receive the faith, and have a desire;
but when you are to be baptized, you make known your will to the Teacher, and make a
full confession of your faith with your own mouth."&mdash;<cite>Arnobius</cite>&mdash;a rhetorician who wrote
in the latter half of the third century.</p>

<p>"In the primitive church, instruction preceded baptism, agreeable to the order of
Jesus Christ&mdash;'Go, teach all nations, baptizing them,' etc."&mdash;<em>Saurin</em> (a French protestant;
1677-1730.)</p>

<p>"In the first two centuries, no one was baptized, except, being instructed in the faith
and acquainted with the doctrine of Christ, he was able to profess himself a believer;
because of those words, 'He that believeth and is baptized.'"&mdash;<em>Salmasius</em> (a French
author; 1588-1653).</p>

<p><b>2. Historical Notes on Infant Baptism.</b>&mdash;"The baptism of infants, in the
first two centuries after Christ, was altogether unknown.... The custom of baptizing
infants did not begin before the third age after Christ was born. In the former
ages no trace of it appears; and it was introduced without the command of Christ."&mdash;<em>Curcellaeus.</em></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>

<p>"It is certain that Christ did not ordain infant baptism.... We cannot prove
that the apostles ordained infant baptism. From those places where baptism of a whole
family is mentioned (as in Acts xvi, 33; I Cor. i, 16) we can draw no such conclusion,
because the inquiry is still to be made, whether there were any children in the families of
such an age that they were not capable of any intelligent reception of Christianity; for
this is the only point on which the case turns.... As baptism was closely united
with a conscious entrance on Christian communion, faith and baptism were always connected
with one another; and thus it is in the highest degree probable that baptism was
performed only in instances where both could meet together, and that the practice of
infant baptism was unknown at this (the apostolic) period.... That not till so
late a period as (at least certainly not earlier than) Irenæus, a trace of infant baptism appears;
and that it first became recognized as an apostolic tradition in the course of the
third century, is evidence rather against than for the admission of its apostolic origin."&mdash;<em>Johann
Neander</em> (a German theologian who flourished in the first half of the present
century).</p>

<p>"Let them therefore come when they are grown up&mdash;when they can understand&mdash;when
they are taught whither they are to come. Let them become Christians when they can
know Christ."&mdash;<em>Tertullian</em> (one of the Latin "Christian Fathers"; he lived from 150 to
220 A. D.) Tertullian's almost violent opposition to the practice of pedobaptism is cited
by Neander as "a proof that it was then not usually considered an apostolic ordinance;
for in that case he would hardly have ventured to speak so strongly against it."</p>

<p>Martin Luther, writing in the early part of the sixteenth century, declared: "It cannot
be proven by the sacred scriptures that infant baptism was instituted by Christ, or
begun by the first Christians after the apostles."</p>

<p>"By <em>tekna</em> the Apostle understands, not infants, but posterity; in which signification
the word occurs in many places of the New Testament (see among others John viii, 39);
whence it appears that the argument which is very commonly taken from this passage
for the baptism of infants, is of no force, and good for nothing."&mdash;<em>Limborch</em> (a native of
Holland, and a theologian of repute; he lived 1633-1712).</p>

<p><b>3. Baptism Necessary.</b>&mdash;"That Gospel baptism is necessary to salvation, is
abundantly evidenced in the sacred writings. Christ, the highest authority known to
man, asserted this most emphatically when He said to Nicodemus: 'Verily, verily, I say
unto thee, Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the
kingdom of God' (John iii, 5). So important did the Savior consider baptism, that
when He went to John to be baptized, and John forbade Him, He replied to him:
'Suffer it to be so now, for thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness' (Matt. iii,
13-15). In this he taught John the doctrine that a fulness of righteousness, or salvation,
could not be received without it. The prophet Nephi, who lived nearly six hundred
years before the birth of our Savior, clearly understood the necessity of baptism. Said
he: 'And now, if the Lamb of God, he being holy, should have need to be baptized by
water, to fulfil all righteousness, O then, how much more need have we, being unholy,
to be baptized, yea, even by water?' (II Nephi xxxi, 5). The prophet Mormon, who
lived nearly one thousand years after Nephi, also taught the necessity of following the
example of our Savior in being baptized, first by water (Mormon vii, 10)."&mdash;<cite>Compendium</cite>,

<h3>BAPTISM.&mdash;Continued.</h3>

<p class="center">MODE OF BAPTISM.</p>

<p><b>1. Method of Administering Baptism Important.</b>&mdash;In considering
the object and the necessity of baptism, much has
been said and inferred concerning the importance which the
Lord attaches to this initiatory rite; it is natural that the
mode of administering the ordinance should also be specifically
prescribed. Many Christian sects have some established
rite of initiation, in which water figures as a necessary
element; though with some the ceremony consists in nothing
more than the placing of the priest's moistened finger on
the forehead of the candidate; or in the pouring or sprinkling
of water on the face; while others consider immersion
of the whole body as requisite. The Latter-day Saints hold
that the scriptures are devoid of ambiguity regarding the
acceptable mode of baptism; and they boldly declare their
belief that bodily immersion by a duly authorized servant or
representative of the Savior is the only true form. Their
reasons for this belief may be summed up as follows:
(1) The derivation and former usage of the word baptism,
and its cognates, betoken immersion. (2) The symbolism of
the rite is preserved in no other form. (3) Scriptural authority,
the revealed word of God through the mouths of
ancient and modern prophets, prescribes immersion as the
true form of baptism.</p>

<p><b>2. (1.) The Word "Baptism</b>," as is generally admitted by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
philologists, is derived from the Greek <i lang="el" xml:lang="el">bapto</i>, <i lang="el" xml:lang="el">baptizo</i>, meaning
literally to dip, or to immerse. As is true in the case
of every living language, words may undergo great changes
of meaning; and some writers declare that the term in
question may be as applicable to pouring or sprinkling
with water as to actual immersion. It becomes interesting,
therefore, to inquire as to the current meaning of the
term at or near the time of Christ; for, as the Savior
evidently deemed it unnecessary, in the course of His instructions
concerning baptism, to modify or in any way to
enlarge upon the meaning of the term, the word "baptize"
evidently conveyed a very definite meaning to those who
received His teachings. From the use made of the original
term by the Latin and Greek authors,<a name="FNanchor_405_405" id="FNanchor_405_405"></a><a href="#Footnote_405_405" class="fnanchor">[405]</a> it is plain that they
understood an actual immersion in water as the only true
signification. The modern Greeks understand baptism to
mean a burial in water, and therefore, as they adopt the
profession of Christianity, they practice immersion as the
only proper form in baptism.<a name="FNanchor_406_406" id="FNanchor_406_406"></a><a href="#Footnote_406_406" class="fnanchor">[406]</a> Concerning this kind of
argument, it should be remembered that philological evidence
is not of the most decisive order. Let us pass then to
the consideration of other and stronger reasons.</p>

<p><b>3. (2.) The Symbolism of the Baptismal Rite</b> is preserved
in no form other than immersion. The Savior compared
baptism to a birth, and declared such to be essential to the
life that leads to the kingdom of God.<a name="FNanchor_407_407" id="FNanchor_407_407"></a><a href="#Footnote_407_407" class="fnanchor">[407]</a> Surely none can
say that a birth is represented by a simple sprinkling of
water on the face or head. Not the least of the distinctions
which have contributed to Christ's pre-eminence as a
teacher of teachers, consists in His precise and forceful use
of language; His comparisons are always strong, His metaphors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
ever expressive, His parables convincing; and so inappropriate
a comparison as is implied in such a false representation
of birth, would be entirely foreign to the Great
Teacher's methods.</p>

<p><b>4.</b> Baptism has also been very impressively compared to
a burial, followed by a resurrection; and in this symbol of
the bodily death and resurrection of His Son has God
promised to grant remission of sins. In writing to the
Romans, Paul says:&mdash;"Know ye not, that so many of us as
were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his
death? Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into
death: that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by
the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in
newness of life. For if we have been planted together in
the likeness of his death, we shall be also in the likeness of
his resurrection."<a name="FNanchor_408_408" id="FNanchor_408_408"></a><a href="#Footnote_408_408" class="fnanchor">[408]</a> And again, the same apostle writes:
"Buried with him in baptism, wherein also ye are risen
with him through the faith of the operation of God, who
hath raised him from the dead."<a name="FNanchor_409_409" id="FNanchor_409_409"></a><a href="#Footnote_409_409" class="fnanchor">[409]</a> Among all the varied
forms of baptism practiced by man, immersion alone typifies
a birth, marking the beginning of a new career; or the sleep
of the grave, with subsequent victory over death.</p>

<p><b>5. (3.) Scriptural Authority</b> warrants none other form
than immersion. Christ Himself was baptized by immersion.
We read that after the ceremony, He "went up straightway
out of the water."<a name="FNanchor_410_410" id="FNanchor_410_410"></a><a href="#Footnote_410_410" class="fnanchor">[410]</a> That the baptism of the Savior was
acceptable before His Father is abundantly proved by the
manifestations immediately following the ordinance&mdash;in the
descent of the Holy Ghost, and the declaration, "This is
my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased." John, surnamed,
because of his Divine commission, the Baptist, baptized<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
in the river Jordan;<a name="FNanchor_411_411" id="FNanchor_411_411"></a><a href="#Footnote_411_411" class="fnanchor">[411]</a> and shortly afterward we hear of
him baptizing in Ænon, near to Salim, "because there was
much water there;"<a name="FNanchor_412_412" id="FNanchor_412_412"></a><a href="#Footnote_412_412" class="fnanchor">[412]</a> yet had he been baptizing by sprinkling,
a small quantity of water would have sufficed for a
multitude.</p>

<p><b>6.</b> We read of baptism following the somewhat speedy
conversion of the Ethiopian eunuch, treasurer to the queen,
Candace. To him Philip preached the doctrine of Christ,
as they rode together in the Ethiopian's chariot; the eunuch,
believing the words of his inspired instructor, desired baptism,
and Philip consenting, "he commanded the chariot
to stand still, and they both <em>went down into the water</em>, both
Philip and the eunuch, and he baptized him. And when
they were come <em>up out of the water</em>, the Spirit of the Lord
caught away Philip that the eunuch saw him no more; and
he went on his way rejoicing."<a name="FNanchor_413_413" id="FNanchor_413_413"></a><a href="#Footnote_413_413" class="fnanchor">[413]</a> Surely the record in this
case is explicit, that immersion was the mode practiced by
Philip.</p>

<p><b>7. History, other than Scriptural</b>, proves that for more than
two centuries after Christ, immersion was the only mode of
baptism generally practiced by professed Christians; and
not indeed till near the close of the thirteenth century did
other forms become general.<a name="FNanchor_414_414" id="FNanchor_414_414"></a><a href="#Footnote_414_414" class="fnanchor">[414]</a> Distortions of ordinances
instituted by authority may be expected, if the outward form
of such ordinances be attempted after the authority to
minister in them has been taken away; yet such distortions
are of gradual growth; deformities resulting from constitutional
ailments do not develop in a day; we may with reason,
therefore, look for the closest imitation of the true form of
baptism, as indeed of any other ordinance instituted by
Christ, in the period immediately following His personal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
ministry, and that of His apostles. Then, as the darkness
of unbelief deepened, the authority given of Christ having
been taken from the earth with His martyred servants, many
innovations appeared, dignitaries of the various churches
becoming a law unto themselves and to their adherents.
Early in the third century, the Bishop of Carthage decided
that persons of weak health might be acceptably baptized
by sprinkling; and with the license thus given, the true
form of baptism gradually fell into disfavor, and unauthorized
practices devised by man took its place.</p>

<p><b>8. Baptism among the Nephites</b> was performed by immersion
only. The wide extent to which baptism was preached
and practiced among the people from Lehi to Moroni has
been already shown. When the Savior appeared to His
people on this hemisphere, He gave them very explicit instructions
as to the method of procedure in administering the
ordinance. These are his words:&mdash;"Verily I say unto you,
that whoso repenteth of his sins through your words, and
desireth to be baptized in my name, on this wise shall ye
baptize them: behold, ye shall go down and stand in the
water, and in my name shall ye baptize them. And now
behold, these are the words which ye shall say, calling them
by name, saying, <em>Having authority given me of Jesus Christ,
I baptize you in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and
of the Holy Ghost: Amen.</em> And then shall ye immerse them
in the water, and come forth again out of the water."<a name="FNanchor_415_415" id="FNanchor_415_415"></a><a href="#Footnote_415_415" class="fnanchor">[415]</a></p>

<p><b>9. Modern Baptism</b>, as prescribed by revelation, is after
the same pattern. The first baptisms in the present dispensation
were those of Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery,
who baptized each other according to the directions of the
heavenly messenger from whom they had received authority
to administer in this holy ordinance, and who was none
other than John the Baptist of a former dispensation, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
forerunner of the Messiah. Joseph Smith thus describes the
event:&mdash;"Accordingly we went and were baptized; I baptized
him [Oliver Cowdery] first, and afterwards he baptized
me.... Immediately on our coming up out of the
water after we had been baptized, we experienced great and
glorious blessings."</p>

<p><b>10.</b> In a revelation concerning Church government,
dated April, 1830, the Lord prescribed the exact mode of
baptism as He desires the ordinance administered in the
present dispensation. He said: "Baptism is to be administered
in the following manner unto all those who repent:&mdash;The
person who is called of God and has authority from
Jesus Christ to baptize, shall go down into the water with
the person who has presented him or herself for baptism,
and shall say, calling him or her by name&mdash;<em>Having been commissioned
of Jesus Christ, I baptize you in the name of the
Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. Amen.</em> Then
shall he immerse him or her in the water, and come forth
again out of the water."<a name="FNanchor_416_416" id="FNanchor_416_416"></a><a href="#Footnote_416_416" class="fnanchor">[416]</a></p>

<p><b>11.</b> The Lord would not have prescribed the words of
this ceremony did He not desire them used, and therefore
elders and priests of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day
Saints have no personal authority to change the form
given of God, by additions, omissions, or alterations of any
kind.</p>


<p class="center">BAPTISM AND "RE-BAPTISM."</p>

<p><b>12. A Repetition of the Baptismal Ordinance</b> on the same
individual is allowable under certain specific conditions.
Thus, if one, having entered the Church by baptism, withdraws
from it, or is excommunicated therefrom, and afterwards
repents and desires to regain his standing in the
Church, he can do so only through baptism. However,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
such is a repetition of the initiatory ordinance as previously
administered. There is no ordinance of "re-baptism" in
the Church distinct in nature, form, or purpose, from other
baptism; and, therefore, in administering baptism to a subject
who has been formerly baptized, the form of the ceremony
is exactly the same as in first baptisms. The expression,
"I re-baptize you," in place of "I baptize you," and
the additions "for the renewal of your covenants," or "for
the remission of your sins," though such have been used by
officiating elders and priests of the Church, are not authorized.
The dictates of reason unite with the voice of the
presiding authorities of the Church in discountenancing
any erratic departures from the course prescribed by the
Lord; changes in ceremonies given by authority can be
effected only by authority, and we must look for direction
in these matters to those who hold the keys of power in the
Church.</p>

<p><b>13.</b> A "re-baptism," that is, a repetition of the simple
ordinance as at first performed, may be allowed under particular
circumstances, which seemingly warrant this extraordinary
step. Thus, in the early days of the Church in
Utah, its members having come hither through much tribulation,
long and toilsome journeyings, accompanied in many
instances by prolonged suspension of Church gatherings and
other formal religious observances, it was wisely suggested
by President Young that the members of the Church renew
the witness of their allegiance to the cause of God, by each
one seeking baptism. Then, as other companies of immigrants
continued to arrive, the same conditions of long
travel and rough experience applying in their cases, and
further, as many of them hailed from foreign branches of
the Church, still incompletely organized, through which
circumstances the actual standing of the members could not
be readily proved, the same rite of a second baptism was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
allowed to them. However, it was never intended that
such a practice should become general; far less that it
should be established as a permanent rule of action in the
Church. The Latter-day Saints do not profess to be Anabaptists.</p>

<p><b>14. "Re-baptisms" Recorded in Scripture</b> are very few; and
in every instance, the existence of special circumstances
justifying the action are readily seen. Thus, we read of
Paul baptizing certain professed disciples at Ephesus though
they had already been baptized after the manner of John's
baptism.<a name="FNanchor_417_417" id="FNanchor_417_417"></a><a href="#Footnote_417_417" class="fnanchor">[417]</a> But in this case, the apostle was evidently, and
with good reason, suspicious that the baptism of which
these spoke had been performed by unauthorized hands, or
at least without the proper preliminary education of the
candidates; for when he tested the efficacy of their baptism
by asking "Have ye received the Holy Ghost since ye believed?"
they answered him, "We have not so much as
heard whether there be any Holy Ghost." Then asked he
in surprise, "Unto what then were ye baptized?" and they
replied, "Unto John's baptism." But Paul knew, as we
know, that John preached the baptism of repentance by
water, but always declared that such was but a preliminary
to the greater baptism by fire, which Christ should bring.
Therefore, in view of such unsatisfactory evidence concerning
the validity of their baptism, Paul had baptism in the
name of the Lord Jesus administered unto these twelve
devout Ephesians, after which he laid his hands upon them,
and they received the Holy Ghost.</p>

<p><b>15.</b> The baptism instituted by Christ among the
Nephites,<a name="FNanchor_418_418" id="FNanchor_418_418"></a><a href="#Footnote_418_418" class="fnanchor">[418]</a> was very largely a "re-baptism;" for as we have
already seen, the doctrine of baptism had been taught and
practiced among the people from the time of Lehi; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
surely, Nephi, the first to whom the Savior gave authority
to baptize after His departure, had been previously baptized,
for he and his co-laborers in the ministry had been
most zealous in declaring the necessity of baptism.<a name="FNanchor_419_419" id="FNanchor_419_419"></a><a href="#Footnote_419_419" class="fnanchor">[419]</a> Yet
in this case also, there had probably arisen much impropriety
in the manner, and perhaps in the spirit, of administering
the ordinance; for the Savior in giving minute directions
concerning the form of baptism, reproved them for
the spirit of contention and disputation that had previously
existed among them regarding the ordinance.<a name="FNanchor_420_420" id="FNanchor_420_420"></a><a href="#Footnote_420_420" class="fnanchor">[420]</a> Therefore,
the baptism of these people was made valid by an authoritative
administration after the manner prescribed of
God.</p>

<p><b>16.</b> Incidentally, our attention is arrested by the fact
that in these cases of re-baptism among the Nephites, the
same ritual was used as in first baptism, and this by explicit
instructions of the Lord, coupled with an impressive warning
against disputation. Why should the priests in this day
seek to alter the form to suit the case of a candidate who
has formerly been baptized?</p>

<p><b>17. Repeated Baptisms of the Same Person</b> are not sanctioned
in the Church. It is easy to fall into the error of
believing that baptism offers a ready means of gaining forgiveness
of sins however oft repeated. Such a belief tends
rather to excuse than to prevent sin, inasmuch as the hurtful
effects seem to be so easily averted. Neither the written law
of God, nor the instructions of His living Priesthood, designate
baptism as a means of securing forgiveness by those
who are already within the fold of Christ. Unto such, forgiveness
of all sin, if not unto death, has been promised on
confession, and repentance with full purpose of heart; of
them a repetition of the baptismal rite has not been required<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
and, were subjects of this class repeatedly baptized,
unto them remission of sins would in no wise come,
except they repent most sincerely. The frailties of mortality
and our proneness to sin lead us continually into error;
but if we covenant with the Lord at the waters of baptism,
and thereafter seek to observe His law, He is merciful to
pardon our little transgressions, through repentance sincere
and true; and without such repentance, baptism, however oft
repeated, would avail us nothing.</p>


<p class="center">BAPTISM FOR THE DEAD.</p>

<p><b>18. Baptism Required of All.</b>&mdash;The universal applicability
of the law of baptism has been already dwelt upon. Compliance
with the ordinance has been shown to be essential
to salvation, and this condition applies to all mankind.
Nowhere in scripture is a distinction made in this regard
between the living and the dead. The dead are those who
have lived in mortality upon earth; the living are mortals
who yet shall pass through the ordained change which we
call death. All are children of the same Father, all to be
judged and rewarded or punished by the same unerring
justice, with the same interpositions of benignant mercy.
Christ's atoning sacrifice was offered, not alone for the few
who lived upon the earth while He was in the flesh, nor for
those who were to be born in mortality after His death, but
for all inhabitants of earth then past, present, and future.
He was ordained of the Father to be a judge of both quick
and dead;<a name="FNanchor_421_421" id="FNanchor_421_421"></a><a href="#Footnote_421_421" class="fnanchor">[421]</a> He is Lord alike of living and dead,<a name="FNanchor_422_422" id="FNanchor_422_422"></a><a href="#Footnote_422_422" class="fnanchor">[422]</a> as men
speak of dead and living, though all are to be placed in the
same position before Him; there will be but a single class,
for all live unto Him.<a name="FNanchor_423_423" id="FNanchor_423_423"></a><a href="#Footnote_423_423" class="fnanchor">[423]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<p><b>19. The Gospel yet Unknown to Many.</b>&mdash;Of the multitudes
of human beings who have existed on the earth, but
few have heard and fewer have obeyed, the law of the gospel.
In the course of the world's history there have been
long periods of spiritual darkness, when the gospel was not
preached upon the earth; when there was no authorized representative
of the Lord officiating in the saving ordinances
of the kingdom. Such a condition has never existed except
as the result of the unbelief and waywardness of
the people. When mankind have persistently trodden
the pearls of truth into the mire, and have sought to slay
and rend the bearers of the jewels, in justice not more than
in mercy these treasures of heaven have been taken and
withheld until a more appreciative posterity could be raised
up. It may very properly be asked, What provisions are
made in the economy of God for the eventual salvation of
those who have thus neglected the requirements of the Word,
and for those who have never heard the gospel tidings?</p>

<p><b>20.</b> According to certain dogmas that have prevailed
among many so-called Christian sects during the obscurity
of the spiritual night, and which are yet zealously promulgated,
never-ending punishment or interminable bliss, unchanging
in kind or degree, shall be the lot of every soul;
the award being made according to the condition of the
spirit at the time of bodily death; a life of sin being thus
entirely nullified by a death-bed repentance; and an honorable
career, if unmarked by ceremonies of the established
sects, being followed by the tortures of hell without the hope
of relief. Such a belief must rank with the dread heresy
which proclaims the condemnation of innocent babes who
have not been sprinkled by man's assumed authority.</p>

<p><b>21.</b> It is blasphemous to thus attribute caprice and vindictiveness
to the Divine nature. In the justice of God, no
soul shall be condemned under any law which has not been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
made known unto him. It is true, eternal punishment has
been decreed as the lot of the wicked; but the true meaning
of this terrible expression has been given by the Lord Himself:<a name="FNanchor_424_424" id="FNanchor_424_424"></a><a href="#Footnote_424_424" class="fnanchor">[424]</a>
eternal punishment is God's punishment; endless punishment
is God's punishment, for "Endless" and "Eternal"
are among His names, and the words are descriptive of
His attributes. No soul will be kept in prison or continued
in torment beyond the time requisite to work the needed
reformation and to vindicate justice, for which ends alone
punishment is imposed. And no one will be permitted to
enter any kingdom of glory to which he is not entitled
through obedience to law.</p>

<p><b>22. The Gospel to be Preached to the Dead.</b>&mdash;It is plain,
then, that the gospel must be proclaimed in the spirit
world; and that such work is provided for, the scriptures
abundantly prove. Peter, describing the mission of his
Redeemer, thus declares this truth:&mdash;"For this cause was
the gospel preached also to them that are dead, that they
might be judged according to men in the flesh, but live according
to God in the spirit."<a name="FNanchor_425_425" id="FNanchor_425_425"></a><a href="#Footnote_425_425" class="fnanchor">[425]</a> The inauguration of this
work among the dead was effected by Christ in the interval
between His death and resurrection. While His body lay
in the tomb, His spirit ministered to the spirits of the
departed:&mdash;"By which also he went and preached unto
the spirits in prison; which sometime were disobedient
when once the long-suffering of God waited in the days of
Noah, while the ark was a preparing, wherein few, that is,
eight souls, were saved by water."<a name="FNanchor_426_426" id="FNanchor_426_426"></a><a href="#Footnote_426_426" class="fnanchor">[426]</a></p>

<p><b>23.</b> Other scriptures sustain the position, that while in a
disembodied state, Christ went elsewhere than to the place
usually termed heaven,&mdash;the abode of His Father; and that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
He labored among the dead, who greatly needed His ministry.
One of the malefactors who suffered crucifixion by
His side, through humility won from the dying Savior the
promise, "To-day shalt thou be with me in Paradise."<a name="FNanchor_427_427" id="FNanchor_427_427"></a><a href="#Footnote_427_427" class="fnanchor">[427]</a>
And three days afterward, the Lord, then a resurrected
Being, declared to the sorrowing Magdalene, "I have not yet
ascended to my Father."<a name="FNanchor_428_428" id="FNanchor_428_428"></a><a href="#Footnote_428_428" class="fnanchor">[428]</a></p>

<p><b>24.</b> If it was deemed proper and just that the gospel be
carried to the spirits who were disobedient in the days of
Noah, is it not reasonable to conclude that like opportunities
shall be placed within the reach of others who have rejected
the word at different times? For the same spirit of neglect
and disobedience that characterized the time of Noah has
ever existed.<a name="FNanchor_429_429" id="FNanchor_429_429"></a><a href="#Footnote_429_429" class="fnanchor">[429]</a> And further, if, in the plan of God, provisions
be made for the redemption of the wilfully disobedient,
of those who actually spurn the truth, can we believe that
the still greater multitudes of spirits who have never heard
the Gospel are to be left in punishment eternally? No; God
has decreed that even the heathen nations, and those that
knew no law, shall be redeemed.<a name="FNanchor_430_430" id="FNanchor_430_430"></a><a href="#Footnote_430_430" class="fnanchor">[430]</a> The good gifts of the
Father are not confined to this sphere of action, but will be
distributed in justice throughout eternity. Upon all who
reject the word of God in this life shall fall the penalties
provided for such act; but after the debt has been paid, the
prison doors shall be opened, and the spirits once confined in
suffering, now chastened and clean, shall come forth to partake
of the glory provided for their class.</p>

<p><b>25. Christ's Work among the Dead was Foretold.</b>&mdash;Centuries
before Christ came in the flesh, the prophets rejoiced
in the knowledge that through Him would salvation be carried
to the dead as well as to the living. Speaking of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
punishment to be brought upon the proud and haughty of
the earth, Isaiah declares: "And they shall be gathered
together, as prisoners are gathered in the pit, and shall be
shut up in the prison, and after many days shall they be
visited."<a name="FNanchor_431_431" id="FNanchor_431_431"></a><a href="#Footnote_431_431" class="fnanchor">[431]</a> The same great prophet thus testifies concerning
the work of the coming Redeemer; He is "to open the blind
eyes, to bring out the prisoners from the prison, and them
that sit in darkness out of the prison house."<a name="FNanchor_432_432" id="FNanchor_432_432"></a><a href="#Footnote_432_432" class="fnanchor">[432]</a> And David,
singing to the music of inspiration concerning the redemption
from the grave, exclaims: "Therefore my heart is glad,
and my glory rejoiceth: my flesh also shall rest in hope.
For thou wilt not leave my soul in hell; neither wilt thou
suffer thine Holy One to see corruption. Thou wilt shew
me the path of life; in thy presence is fulness of joy; at thy
right hand there are pleasures for evermore."<a name="FNanchor_433_433" id="FNanchor_433_433"></a><a href="#Footnote_433_433" class="fnanchor">[433]</a></p>

<p><b>26. Work of the Living for the Dead.</b>&mdash;The redemption
of the dead will be effected in strict accordance with the
law of God, which is written in justice and framed in mercy.
It is alike impossible for any spirit, in the flesh or disembodied,
to obtain even the promise of eternal glory, except
on condition of obedience to the laws and ordinances of the
gospel. And, as baptism is essential to the salvation of the
living, it is likewise indispensable to the salvation of the
dead. This was known by the Saints of old, and hence the
doctrine of baptism for the dead was taught among them.
In an epistle addressed to the Saints at Corinth, Paul expounded
the principles of the resurrection, whereby the
bodies of the dead are to be brought forth from the graves.
"Christ the first fruits, and afterward they that are
Christ's," and as proof that this doctrine of the resurrection
was included in the gospel as they had received and professed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
it, the apostle asks: "Else what shall they do which
are baptized for the dead, if the dead rise not at all? why
are they then baptized for the dead?"<a name="FNanchor_434_434" id="FNanchor_434_434"></a><a href="#Footnote_434_434" class="fnanchor">[434]</a> These words are
unambiguous, and the fact that they are presented without
explanation or comment argues that the principle of baptism
for the dead was understood among the people to whom the
letter was addressed.</p>

<p><b>27.</b> The necessity of vicarious work is here shown,&mdash;the
living laboring in behalf of the dead; the children doing
for their progenitors what is beyond the power of the latter
to do for themselves. Many and various are the interpretations
rendered by erring human wisdom on this plain statement
of Paul's; yet the simple and earnest seeker after
truth finds little difficulty in comprehending the meaning.
In words which form the closing sentences of the Old Testament,
the prophet Malachi predicted the great work to be
carried on in behalf of the dead during the latter days:
"Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the
coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord: And he
shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children, and
the heart of the children to their fathers, lest I come and
smite the earth with a curse."<a name="FNanchor_435_435" id="FNanchor_435_435"></a><a href="#Footnote_435_435" class="fnanchor">[435]</a> It is a current belief among
many Bible students, that this prophecy had reference to
the birth and ministry of John the Baptist,<a name="FNanchor_436_436" id="FNanchor_436_436"></a><a href="#Footnote_436_436" class="fnanchor">[436]</a> upon whom
indeed rested and remained the spirit and power of Elias,
as the angel had foretold;<a name="FNanchor_437_437" id="FNanchor_437_437"></a><a href="#Footnote_437_437" class="fnanchor">[437]</a> but we have no record of Elijah
ministering unto John; and moreover the results of the
latter's ministry warrant no conclusion that in him did the
prophecy find its full realization.</p>

<p><b>28.</b> We must therefore look to a later date in the world's
history for a fulfillment of Malachi's prediction. On the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
21st of September, 1823, Joseph Smith<a name="FNanchor_438_438" id="FNanchor_438_438"></a><a href="#Footnote_438_438" class="fnanchor">[438]</a> received a visitation
of a heavenly being who announced himself as Moroni, sent
from the presence of God. In the course of his instructions
to the chosen youth, this heavenly personage quoted the
prophecy of Malachi, already referred to, but in language
slightly different from, and certainly more expressive than,
that appearing in the ordinary translation of the scriptures;
the angel's version is as follows: "For behold the day
cometh that shall burn as an oven, and all the proud, yea
and all that do wickedly, shall burn as stubble, for they
that come shall burn them, saith the Lord of Hosts, that it
shall leave them neither root nor branch. Behold I will
reveal unto you the Priesthood by the hand of Elijah the
prophet, before the coming of the great and dreadful day of
the Lord. And he shall plant in the hearts of the children
the promises made to the fathers, and the hearts of the
children shall turn to their fathers; if it were not so the
whole earth would be utterly wasted at His coming."<a name="FNanchor_439_439" id="FNanchor_439_439"></a><a href="#Footnote_439_439" class="fnanchor">[439]</a></p>

<p><b>29.</b> In a glorious manifestation to Joseph Smith and
Oliver Cowdery, given in the Kirtland Temple, April 3,
1836, there appeared unto them Elijah the prophet, who
was taken to heaven without tasting death; he declared
unto them: "Behold, the time has fully come which was
spoken of by the mouth of Malachi, testifying that he
(Elijah) should be sent before the great and dreadful day
of the Lord come, to turn the hearts of the fathers to the
children and the children to the fathers, lest the whole
earth be smitten with a curse. Therefore the keys of this
dispensation are committed into your hands, and by this
ye may know that the great and dreadful day of the Lord
is near, even at the doors."<a name="FNanchor_440_440" id="FNanchor_440_440"></a><a href="#Footnote_440_440" class="fnanchor">[440]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>
<p><b>30. The Fathers and the Children Mutually Dependent.</b>&mdash;One
of the great principles underlying the doctrine of salvation
for the dead is that of the mutual dependence of the
fathers and the children. As the Prophet Joseph taught the
Saints,<a name="FNanchor_441_441" id="FNanchor_441_441"></a><a href="#Footnote_441_441" class="fnanchor">[441]</a> but for the establishment of a connecting link between
the departed fathers and the living children, the earth
would be smitten with a curse. The plan of God provides
that neither the children nor the fathers can alone be made
perfect; and the necessary union is effected through baptism
and associated ordinances for the dead. The manner
in which the hearts of the children and those of the
fathers are turned toward one another is made plain
through these scriptures. As the children learn that without
the aid of their progenitors they cannot attain perfection,
assuredly will their hearts be opened, their faith will
be kindled, and good works will be attempted, for the redemption
of their dead; and the departed, learning from
the ministers of the gospel laboring among them, that they
must depend upon their children as vicarious saviors, will
seek to sustain their still mortal representatives with faith
and prayer for the perfecting of those labors of love.</p>

<p><b>31.</b> And love, which is a power in itself, is thus intensified.
Aside from the emotions which are stirred within the
soul by the presence of the Divine, there are few feelings
stronger and purer than the love for kindred. Heaven
would not be all we wish were family love unknown there.<a name="FNanchor_442_442" id="FNanchor_442_442"></a><a href="#Footnote_442_442" class="fnanchor">[442]</a>
Affection there will differ from its earthly type, in being
deeper, stronger, purer. And thus in the mercy of God,
His erring, mortal children, who have taken upon themselves
the name of Christ on earth, may become, in a limited
sphere, each a savior in the house of his fathers, and that
too by vicarious labor and sacrifice, rendered in humility,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
and, as represented in the baptismal ordinance, typical of
the death, burial, and resurrection of the Redeemer.</p>

<p><b>32. The Labor for the Dead is Two-fold.</b>&mdash;That performed
on earth would be incomplete but for its supplement and
counterpart beyond the vail. Missionary labor is in progress
there, whereby the tidings of the gospel are carried to
the departed spirits, who thus learn of the work done in
their behalf on earth. What glorious possibilities concerning
the purposes of God are thus presented to our view!
How the mercy of God is magnified by these evidences of
His love! How often do we behold friends and loved ones,
whom we count among earth's fairest and best, stricken
down by the shafts of death, seemingly in spite of the power
of faith and the ministrations of the Priesthood of God! Yet
who of us can tell but that these may be permitted to minister
in the labor of redemption beyond, preaching perhaps
the gospel to the spirits of their forefathers, while others of
the same family are officiating in a similar behalf on earth?</p>

<p><b>33.</b> As far as the Divine will has been revealed, it requires
that the outward ordinances, such as baptism in
water, the laying on of hands for the bestowal of the Holy
Ghost, and the higher endowments that follow, be attended
to on earth, a proper representative in the flesh acting as
proxy for the dead. The results of such labors are to be
left with God. It is not to be supposed that by these ordinances
the departed are in any way compelled to accept the
obligation, nor that they are in the least hindered in the
exercise of their free agency. They will accept or reject,
according to their condition of humility or hostility in respect
to things divine; but the work so done for them on
earth will be of avail when wholesome argument and reason
have shown them their true position.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>


<p class="center">TEMPLES.</p>

<p><b>34. Temples or Other Sacred Places</b> are required for the
performance of these holy ordinances. Whenever an organization
of the priesthood has existed on earth, the Lord has
required the preparation of places suited to His use, where
the rites of His Church could be performed. It is but
proper that such a structure should be the result of the
people's best efforts, inasmuch as it is made by them an
offering unto the Lord. In every age of the world, the
chosen people have been a temple-building people. Shortly
after Israel's deliverance from the bondage of Egypt, the
Lord called upon the people to construct a sanctuary to His
name, the plan of which He minutely specified. Though
this was but a tent, it was elaborately furnished and appointed,
the choicest possessions of the people being used in
its construction.<a name="FNanchor_443_443" id="FNanchor_443_443"></a><a href="#Footnote_443_443" class="fnanchor">[443]</a> And the Lord accepted this offering of
His wandering people, by manifesting His glory therein, and
there revealing Himself.<a name="FNanchor_444_444" id="FNanchor_444_444"></a><a href="#Footnote_444_444" class="fnanchor">[444]</a> When the people had settled in
the promised land, the Tabernacle of the congregation was
given a more permanent resting place;<a name="FNanchor_445_445" id="FNanchor_445_445"></a><a href="#Footnote_445_445" class="fnanchor">[445]</a> yet it still was honored
for its sacred purpose, until superseded by the Temple
of Solomon as the sanctuary of the Lord.</p>

<p><b>35.</b> This temple, one of the most gorgeous structures
ever erected by man for sacred service, was dedicated with
imposing ceremonies; but its splendor was of short duration;
for, within less than forty years from the time of its completion,
its glory declined, and finally it fell a prey to the flames.
A partial restoration of the temple was made after the Jews
returned from their captivity; and through the friendly
influence of Cyrus and Darius, the temple of Zerubbabel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
was dedicated.<a name="FNanchor_446_446" id="FNanchor_446_446"></a><a href="#Footnote_446_446" class="fnanchor">[446]</a> That the Lord accepted this effort of His
people to maintain a sanctuary to His name, is fully shown
by the spirit that actuated its officers, among whom were
Zechariah, Haggai, and Malachi. This temple remained
standing for nearly five centuries; and, but a few years
before the birth of the Savior, the reconstruction of the
edifice was begun by wicked Herod the Great, and the term
"Temple of Herod" passed into history.<a name="FNanchor_447_447" id="FNanchor_447_447"></a><a href="#Footnote_447_447" class="fnanchor">[447]</a> The veil of this
temple was rent at the time of the crucifixion,<a name="FNanchor_448_448" id="FNanchor_448_448"></a><a href="#Footnote_448_448" class="fnanchor">[448]</a> and in the
year 70 A. D. the destruction of the building was accomplished
by Titus.</p>

<p><b>36. Modern Temples.</b>&mdash;From that time until the present
dispensation, no other temples have been reared on the
eastern continent. It is true, imposing edifices have been
erected for the purposes of worship; but a colossal structure
does not necessarily constitute a temple. A temple is more
than a church-building, a meeting-house, a tabernacle, or a
synagogue; it is a place specially prepared by dedication
unto the Lord, and marked by His acceptance, for the performing
of the ordinances pertaining to the Holy Priesthood.
The Latter-day Saints, true to the characteristics of
the chosen of God,<a name="FNanchor_449_449" id="FNanchor_449_449"></a><a href="#Footnote_449_449" class="fnanchor">[449]</a> have been from the first a temple-building
people. Only a few months after the organization of
the Church in the present dispensation, the Lord made reference
to a temple which was to be built.<a name="FNanchor_450_450" id="FNanchor_450_450"></a><a href="#Footnote_450_450" class="fnanchor">[450]</a> In July, 1831,
the Lord designated a spot in Independence, Mo., as the
site of a future temple;<a name="FNanchor_451_451" id="FNanchor_451_451"></a><a href="#Footnote_451_451" class="fnanchor">[451]</a> but the work of construction
thereon has not yet been consummated, as is likewise the
case with the temple site at Far West, on which the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
corner-stones were laid July 4, 1838, and relaid April 26,
1839.</p>

<p><b>37.</b> The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints
has constructed temples, each an imposing and costly
structure, at Kirtland, Ohio; Nauvoo, Illinois; St. George,
Logan, Manti, and Salt Lake City, Utah; Cardston,
Canada; and Laie, Hawaiian Islands. The temples at Kirtland
and Nauvoo were abandoned as the members of the
Church who had built them through sacrifice yet untold
were driven westward by the force of persecution. The
building at Kirtland is now used as an ordinary meeting-house
by a small sect that is but little known and that
evinces no activity in the sacred labors for which temples
are built. The temple at Nauvoo was destroyed through
malicious incendiarism. The magnitude and grandeur of
the sacred labors accomplished in the temples of the present
dispensation, for the salvation of both the living and the
dead, give assurance of the Lord's gracious acceptance.<a name="FNanchor_452_452" id="FNanchor_452_452"></a><a href="#Footnote_452_452" class="fnanchor">[452]</a></p>


<h3>NOTES.</h3>

<blockquote>

<p><b>1. Usage of the Term "Baptize" in Ancient Times.</b>&mdash;The following
instances show the ordinary meaning attached to the Greek term from which our word
"baptize" is derived. In all, the idea of immersion is plainly intended.&mdash;(For these and
other examples, see Millennial Star, Vol. XXI, pp. 687-688.)</p>

<p>Polybius, a writer of history, who flourished during the second century before Christ,
uses the following expressions: In describing a naval conflict between the Carthaginian
and Roman fleets off the shores of Sicily he says, "If any were hard pressed by the
enemy they withdrew safely back, on account of their fast sailing into the open sea: and
then turning round and falling on those of their pursuers who were in advance, they gave
them frequent blows and 'baptized' many of their vessels."&mdash;Book I, ch. 51.</p>

<p>The same writer thus refers to the passage of the Roman soldiers through the river
Trebia: "When the passage of the river Trebia came on, which had risen above its usual
current, on account of the rain which had fallen, the infantry with difficulty crossed over,
being 'baptized' up to the chest."&mdash;Book III, ch. 72.</p>

<p>Describing a catastrophe which befell the Roman ships at Syracuse, Polybius states:
"Some were upset, but the greater number, their prow being thrown down from a height,
were 'baptized' and became full of sea."</p>

<p>Strabo, who lived during the time of Christ, used the term "baptized" in the same
sense. He thus describes an instrument used in fishing: "And if it fall into the sea it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
is not lost: for it is compacted of oak and pine wood: so that even if the oak is 'baptized'
by its weight, the remaining part floats and is easily recovered."</p>

<p>Strabo refers to the buoyancy of certain saline waters thus: "These have the taste of
salt water, but a different nature, for even persons who cannot swim are not liable to be
'baptized' in them, but float like logs on the surface."</p>

<p>Referring to a salt spring in Tatta, the same writer says: "So easily does the water
form a crust round everything 'baptized' into it that if persons let down a circlet of
rushes they will draw up wreaths of salt."</p>

<p>Speaking of a species of pitch from the lake Sirbonis, Strabo says: "It will float on
the surface owing to the nature of the water, which, as we said, is such as to render
swimming unnecessary, and such that one who walks upon it is not 'baptized.'"</p>

<p>Dio Cassius, speaking of the effects of a severe storm near Rome says: "The vessels
which were in the Tiber, which were lying at anchor near the city, and to the river's
mouth, were 'baptized.'"</p>

<p>The same author thus alludes to the fate of some of Curio's soldiers while fleeing
before the forces of Juba: "Not a few of these fugitives perished, some being knocked
down in their attempts to get on board the vessels, and others, even when in the boats,
being 'baptized' through their weight."</p>

<p>Alluding to the fate of the Byzantians who endeavored to escape the siege by taking
to the sea, he says: "Some of those, from the extreme violence of the wind, were
'baptized.'"</p>

<p><b>2. Baptism among the Greeks.</b>&mdash;"The native Greeks must understand their
own language better than foreigners, and they have always understood the word baptism
to signify dipping; and therefore from their first embracing of Christianity to this day
they have always baptized, and do yet baptize, by immersion."&mdash;<em>Robinson.</em></p>

<p><b>3. Early Form of Christian Baptism.</b>&mdash;History furnishes ample proof that
in the first century after the death of Christ, baptism was administered solely by immersion.
Tertullian thus refers to the immersion ceremony common in his day: "There
is no difference whether one is washed in a sea or in a pool, in a river or in a fountain,
in a lake or in a channel: nor is there any difference between those whom John dipped
in Jordan, and those whom Peter dipped in the Tiber.... We are immersed in
the water."</p>

<p>The following are but a few of the instances on record (see Millennial Star, Vol.
XXI, pp. 769-770):</p>

<p>Justin Martyr describes the ceremony as practiced by himself. First describing the
preparatory examination of the candidate, he proceeds: "After that they are led by us to
where there is water, and are born again in that kind of new birth by which we ourselves
were born again. For upon the name God, the Father and Lord of all, and of Jesus
Christ, our Savior, and of the Holy Spirit, the immersion in water is performed, because
the Christ hath also said, 'Except a man be born again, he cannot enter into the kingdom
of heaven.'"</p>

<p>Bishop Bennet says concerning the practices of the early Christians: "They led them
into the water and laid them down in the water as a man is laid in a grave; and then
they said those words, 'I baptize (or wash) thee in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy
Ghost'; then they raised them up again, and clean garments were put on them; from
whence came the phrases of being baptized into Christ's death, of being buried with Him
by baptism into death, of our being risen with Christ, and of our putting on the Lord
Jesus Christ, of putting off the old man, and putting on the new."</p>

<p>"That the apostles immersed whom they baptized there is no doubt.... And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
that the ancient church followed their example is very clearly evinced by innumerable
testimonies of the fathers."&mdash;<em>Vossius.</em></p>

<p>"Burying as it were the person baptized in the water, and raising him out again, without
question was anciently the more usual method."&mdash;<em>Archbishop Secker.</em></p>

<p>"'Immersion' was the usual method in which baptism was administered in the early
Church.... Immersion was undoubtedly a common mode of administering baptism,
and was not discontinued when infant baptism prevailed.... Sprinkling
gradually took the place of immersion without any formal renunciation of the latter."&mdash;<em>Canon
Farrar.</em></p>

<p><b>4. The Fathers and the Children.</b>&mdash;"The revelation in our day of the doctrine
of baptism for the dead may be said to have constituted a new epoch in the history
of our race. At the time the Prophet Joseph received that revelation, the belief was
general in Christendom that at death the destiny of the soul was fixed irrevocably and
for all eternity. If not rewarded with endless happiness, then endless torment was its
doom, beyond all possibility of redemption or change. The horrible and monstrous
doctrine, so much at variance with every element of Divine justice, was generally believed,
that the heathen nations who had died without a knowledge of the true God, and the
redemption wrought out by His Son Jesus Christ, would all be eternally consigned to
hell. The belief upon this point is illustrated by the reply of a certain Bishop to the
inquiry of the king of the Franks, when the king was about to submit to baptism at the
hands of the bishop. The king was a heathen, but had concluded to accept the form of
religion then called Christianity. The thought occurred to him that if baptism were
necessary for his salvation, what had become of his dear ancestors who had died
heathens? This thought framed itself into an inquiry which he addressed to the bishop.
The prelate, less politic than many of his sect, bluntly told him they had gone to hell.
'Then, by Thor, I will go there with them,' said the king, and thereupon refused to
accept baptism or become a Christian."&mdash;Geo. Q. Cannon's <cite>Life of Joseph Smith</cite>, p. 510.</p>

<p><b>5. Temples and Sacred Places.</b>&mdash;"When the Lord brought Israel out of
Egypt, determined to make that people a nation to Himself, as soon as they had arrived
at a safe distance from surrounding peoples, He required them to build a Tabernacle,
which is sometimes called the Temple, wherein He could institute certain ordinances and
regulations for their guidance and worship. This, at the commencement of their pilgrimage
in the wilderness, was made portable, and of the costliest and best material
within their reach; and one of the tribes was set apart to have charge of it and its
appurtenances. Such has ever been the purpose of the Lord. This served them through
their journey and in the promised Canaan, until suitable wealth enabled Solomon to
erect a magnificent Temple on Mount Moriah, since called 'The Hill of Zion,' to which
all Israel came annually to worship or attend conference. The Lord has informed us
(Doc. and Cov. cxxiv, 39) that His people are always commanded to build Temples, or
holy houses, unto His holy name. This accounts for our reading in the Book of Mormon
of so many Temples having been erected on this continent. It also explains why the
Prophet Joseph so early taught the commencement of a Temple in every important location
of the Saints."&mdash;<cite>Compendium</cite>, F. D. Richards and J. A. Little, pp. 301-302. Consult:

<p><b>1. The Holy Ghost Promised.</b>&mdash;John the Baptist, proclaiming
in the wilderness repentance and baptism by water,
foretold a second higher baptism, which he characterized as
being of fire and the Holy Ghost; this was to follow his
administration,<a name="FNanchor_453_453" id="FNanchor_453_453"></a><a href="#Footnote_453_453" class="fnanchor">[453]</a> and was to be given by that Mightier One
whose shoes the Baptist considered himself unworthy to
bear. That the holder of this superior authority was none
other than the Christ is proved by John's solemn record:&mdash;"Behold
the Lamb of God.... This is he of whom
I said, After me cometh a man which is preferred before
me.... And I knew him not, but he that sent me to
baptize with water, the same said unto me: Upon whom
thou shalt see the Spirit descending and remaining on him,
the same is he which baptizeth with the Holy Ghost."<a name="FNanchor_454_454" id="FNanchor_454_454"></a><a href="#Footnote_454_454" class="fnanchor">[454]</a></p>

<p><b>2.</b> In declaring to Nicodemus<a name="FNanchor_455_455" id="FNanchor_455_455"></a><a href="#Footnote_455_455" class="fnanchor">[455]</a> the necessity of baptism,
the Savior did not stop with a reference to the watery birth
alone, that being incomplete without the quickening influence
of the Spirit; born of water and of the Spirit is the
necessary condition of him who is to gain admittance to the
kingdom. Many of the scriptural passages quoted in proof
of the purpose and necessity of baptism, show baptism by
fire and the Holy Ghost to be closely associated with the
prescribed ordinance of immersion in water.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>
<p><b>3.</b> Christ's instructions to His apostles comprise repeated
promises concerning the coming of the "Comforter," and
the "Spirit of Truth,"<a name="FNanchor_456_456" id="FNanchor_456_456"></a><a href="#Footnote_456_456" class="fnanchor">[456]</a> by which expressive terms the Holy
Ghost is designated. In His last interview with the apostles,
at the termination of which He ascended into heaven, the
Lord repeated these assurances of a spiritual baptism, which
was then soon to take place.<a name="FNanchor_457_457" id="FNanchor_457_457"></a><a href="#Footnote_457_457" class="fnanchor">[457]</a> The fulfillment of this great
prediction was realized at the succeeding Pentecost, when
the apostles, having assembled together, were endowed with
mighty power from heaven,<a name="FNanchor_458_458" id="FNanchor_458_458"></a><a href="#Footnote_458_458" class="fnanchor">[458]</a> being filled with the Holy
Ghost so that they spake in tongues other than their own as
the Spirit gave them utterance. Among other manifestations
of this heavenly gift, may be mentioned the appearance
of flames of fire like unto tongues, which rested upon each
of them. The promise so miraculously fulfilled upon themselves
was repeated by the apostles to those who sought
their instruction. Peter, addressing the Jews on that same
day, declared, on the condition of their acceptable repentance
and baptism, "Ye shall receive the gift of the Holy
Ghost."<a name="FNanchor_459_459" id="FNanchor_459_459"></a><a href="#Footnote_459_459" class="fnanchor">[459]</a></p>

<p><b>4.</b> Book of Mormon evidence is not less conclusive regarding
the Holy Spirit's visitation unto those who obey the
requirements of water baptism. Nephi, Lehi's son, bore
solemn record of this truth,<a name="FNanchor_460_460" id="FNanchor_460_460"></a><a href="#Footnote_460_460" class="fnanchor">[460]</a> as made known to him by the
voice of God. And the words of the resurrected Savior to
the Nephites come in plainness indisputable, and with
authority not to be questioned, proclaiming the baptism of
fire and the Holy Ghost unto all those who obey the preliminary
requirements.<a name="FNanchor_461_461" id="FNanchor_461_461"></a><a href="#Footnote_461_461" class="fnanchor">[461]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>

<p><b>5.</b> Unto the Saints in the dispensation of the fulness of
times, the same great promise has been made. "I say unto
you again," spake the Lord in addressing certain elders of
the Church, "that every soul that believeth on your words,
and is baptized by water for the remission of sins shall receive
the Holy Ghost."<a name="FNanchor_462_462" id="FNanchor_462_462"></a><a href="#Footnote_462_462" class="fnanchor">[462]</a></p>

<p><b>6. Personality and Powers of the Holy Ghost.</b>&mdash;The Holy
Ghost is associated with the Father and the Son in the Godhead.
In the light of revelation, we are instructed as to the
distinct personality of the Holy Ghost. He is a Being endowed
with the attributes and powers of Deity, and not a
mere thing, force, or essence. The term Holy Ghost and
its common synonyms, Spirit of God,<a name="FNanchor_463_463" id="FNanchor_463_463"></a><a href="#Footnote_463_463" class="fnanchor">[463]</a> Spirit of the Lord,
or simply, Spirit,<a name="FNanchor_464_464" id="FNanchor_464_464"></a><a href="#Footnote_464_464" class="fnanchor">[464]</a> Comforter,<a name="FNanchor_465_465" id="FNanchor_465_465"></a><a href="#Footnote_465_465" class="fnanchor">[465]</a> and Spirit of Truth,<a name="FNanchor_466_466" id="FNanchor_466_466"></a><a href="#Footnote_466_466" class="fnanchor">[466]</a> occur
in the scriptures with plainly different meanings, referring
in some cases to the person of God, the Holy Ghost, and in
other instances to the power or authority of this great Being.
The context of such passages will show which of these
significations applies.</p>

<p><b>7.</b> The Holy Ghost undoubtedly possesses personal
powers and affections; these attributes exist in Him in perfection.
Thus, He teaches and guides,<a name="FNanchor_467_467" id="FNanchor_467_467"></a><a href="#Footnote_467_467" class="fnanchor">[467]</a> testifies of the
Father and the Son,<a name="FNanchor_468_468" id="FNanchor_468_468"></a><a href="#Footnote_468_468" class="fnanchor">[468]</a> reproves for sin,<a name="FNanchor_469_469" id="FNanchor_469_469"></a><a href="#Footnote_469_469" class="fnanchor">[469]</a> speaks, commands,
and commissions,<a name="FNanchor_470_470" id="FNanchor_470_470"></a><a href="#Footnote_470_470" class="fnanchor">[470]</a> makes intercession for sinners,<a name="FNanchor_471_471" id="FNanchor_471_471"></a><a href="#Footnote_471_471" class="fnanchor">[471]</a> is grieved,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_472_472" id="FNanchor_472_472"></a><a href="#Footnote_472_472" class="fnanchor">[472]</a>
searches and investigates,<a name="FNanchor_473_473" id="FNanchor_473_473"></a><a href="#Footnote_473_473" class="fnanchor">[473]</a> entices,<a name="FNanchor_474_474" id="FNanchor_474_474"></a><a href="#Footnote_474_474" class="fnanchor">[474]</a> and knows all things.<a name="FNanchor_475_475" id="FNanchor_475_475"></a><a href="#Footnote_475_475" class="fnanchor">[475]</a>
These are not mere figurative expressions, but plain statements
of the attributes and characteristics of this great Personage.
That the Holy Spirit is capable of manifesting
Himself in the true form and figure of God, after which
image man is shaped, is indicated by the wonderful interview
between the Spirit and Nephi, in which He revealed
Himself to the prophet, questioned him concerning his
desires and belief, instructed him in the things of God,
speaking face to face with the man. "I spake unto him,"
says Nephi, "as a man speaketh; for I beheld that he was in
the form of a man, yet nevertheless I knew that it was the
Spirit of the Lord; and he spake unto me as a man speaketh
to another."<a name="FNanchor_476_476" id="FNanchor_476_476"></a><a href="#Footnote_476_476" class="fnanchor">[476]</a> However, the Holy Ghost does not possess
a tangible body of flesh and bones, as do both the Father
and the Son, but is a personage of spirit.<a name="FNanchor_477_477" id="FNanchor_477_477"></a><a href="#Footnote_477_477" class="fnanchor">[477]</a></p>

<p><b>8.</b> Much of the confusion existing in our human conceptions
concerning the nature of the Holy Ghost arises
from the common failure to segregate our ideas of His person
and powers. Plainly, such expressions as being filled
with the Holy Ghost,<a name="FNanchor_478_478" id="FNanchor_478_478"></a><a href="#Footnote_478_478" class="fnanchor">[478]</a> and the Spirit falling upon men, have
reference to the powers and influences which emanate from
God, and which are characteristic of Him; for the Holy
Ghost may in this way operate simultaneously upon many
persons, even though they be widely separated; whereas the
actual person of the Holy Ghost cannot be in more than one
place at a time. Yet we read that through the power of the
Spirit, the Father and the Son operate in their creative acts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
and in their general dealings with the human family.<a name="FNanchor_479_479" id="FNanchor_479_479"></a><a href="#Footnote_479_479" class="fnanchor">[479]</a> The
Holy Ghost may be regarded as the minister of the Godhead,
carrying into effect the decisions of the Supreme
Council.</p>

<p><b>9.</b> In the execution of these great purposes, the Holy
Ghost directs and controls the numerous forces of Nature,
of which indeed a few, and these perhaps of the minor order,
wonderful as even the least of them seems to man, have thus
far been made known to the human mind. Gravitation,
sound, heat, light, and the still more mysterious, seemingly
supernatural power of electricity, are but the common servants
of the Holy Spirit in His operations. No earnest
thinker, no sincere investigator supposes that he has yet
learned of all the forces existing in and operating upon matter;
indeed, the observed phenomena of nature, yet wholly
inexplicable to him, far outnumber those for which he has
devised even a partial explanation. There are powers and
forces at the command of God, compared with which, electricity,
the most occult of all the physical agencies controlled
in any degree by man, is as the pack-horse to the
locomotive, the foot messenger to the telegraph, the raft of
logs to the ocean steamer. Man has scarcely glanced at the
enginery of creation; and yet the few forces known to him
have brought about miracles and wonders, which but for
their actual realization would be beyond belief. These
mighty agencies, and the mightier ones still to man unknown,
and many, perhaps, to the present condition of the
human mind unknowable, do not constitute the Holy Ghost,
but the mere means ordained to serve Divine purposes.</p>

<p><b>10.</b> Subtler, mightier, and more mysterious still than
any or all of the physical forces of nature, are the powers
that operate upon conscious organisms, the means by which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
the mind, the heart, the soul of man may be affected. In
our ignorance of the true nature of electric energy, we speak
of it as a fluid; and so by analogy the forces through which the
mind is governed have been called spiritual fluids. The
true nature of these higher powers is unknown to us, for
the conditions of comparison and analogy, so necessary to
our frail human reasoning, are wanting; still the effects are
experienced by all. As the conducting medium in an electric
current is capable of conveying but a limited current,
the maximum strength depending upon the resistance offered
by the conductor, and, as separate circuits of different degrees
of conductivity may carry currents of widely varying
intensity, so human souls are of varied capacity with respect
to the diviner powers. But as the medium is purified, as
the obstructions are removed, so the resistance to the energy
decreases, and the forces manifest themselves with greater
perfection. By analogous processes of purification, may
our spirits be made more susceptible to the power of life,
which is an emanation from the Spirit of God. Therefore
are we taught to pray by word and action for a constantly
increasing portion of the Spirit, that is, the power of the
Spirit, which is a measure of the favor of God unto us.</p>

<p><b>11. The Office of the Holy Ghost</b> in His ministrations
among men is very fully described in scripture. He is a
Teacher sent from the Father;<a name="FNanchor_480_480" id="FNanchor_480_480"></a><a href="#Footnote_480_480" class="fnanchor">[480]</a> and unto those who are entitled
to His tuition He will reveal all things necessary for
the soul's advancement. Through the influences of the
Holy Spirit, the powers of the human mind may be quickened
and increased, so that things past may be brought to
remembrance. He will serve as a guide in things divine
unto all who will obey Him,<a name="FNanchor_481_481" id="FNanchor_481_481"></a><a href="#Footnote_481_481" class="fnanchor">[481]</a> enlightening every man,<a name="FNanchor_482_482" id="FNanchor_482_482"></a><a href="#Footnote_482_482" class="fnanchor">[482]</a> in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
proportion to his humility and obedience;<a name="FNanchor_483_483" id="FNanchor_483_483"></a><a href="#Footnote_483_483" class="fnanchor">[483]</a> unfolding the
mysteries of God,<a name="FNanchor_484_484" id="FNanchor_484_484"></a><a href="#Footnote_484_484" class="fnanchor">[484]</a> as the knowledge thus revealed may tend
to spiritual growth; conveying knowledge from God to
man;<a name="FNanchor_485_485" id="FNanchor_485_485"></a><a href="#Footnote_485_485" class="fnanchor">[485]</a> sanctifying those who have been cleansed through
obedience to the requirements of the gospel;<a name="FNanchor_486_486" id="FNanchor_486_486"></a><a href="#Footnote_486_486" class="fnanchor">[486]</a> manifesting
all things;<a name="FNanchor_487_487" id="FNanchor_487_487"></a><a href="#Footnote_487_487" class="fnanchor">[487]</a> and bearing witness unto men concerning the
existence and infallibility of the Father and the Son.<a name="FNanchor_488_488" id="FNanchor_488_488"></a><a href="#Footnote_488_488" class="fnanchor">[488]</a></p>

<p><b>12.</b> And not alone does the Holy Ghost bring to mind
the past, and explain the things of the present, but His
power is manifested likewise in prophecy concerning the
future;&mdash;"He shall show you things to come," declared the
Savior to the Apostles in promising the advent of the Comforter.
Adam, the first prophet of earth, under the influence
of the Holy Ghost "predicted whatsoever should
befall his posterity unto the latest generation."<a name="FNanchor_489_489" id="FNanchor_489_489"></a><a href="#Footnote_489_489" class="fnanchor">[489]</a></p>

<p><b>13.</b> The power of the Holy Ghost then is the spirit of
prophecy and revelation; His office is that of enlightenment
of the mind, quickening of the intellect, and sanctification
of the soul.</p>

<p><b>14. To Whom is the Holy Ghost given?</b> Not to all indiscriminately.
The Redeemer declared to the apostles of
old, "I will pray to the Father and he shall give you another
Comforter, that he may abide with you forever; Even the
Spirit of truth; whom the world cannot receive, because it
seeth him not, neither knoweth him."<a name="FNanchor_490_490" id="FNanchor_490_490"></a><a href="#Footnote_490_490" class="fnanchor">[490]</a> Clearly, then,
a certain condition of the candidate is requisite before the
Holy Ghost can be bestowed, that is to say, before the person
can receive a right to the company and ministrations of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
the Spirit. God grants the Holy Ghost unto the obedient;
and the bestowal of this gift follows faith, repentance, and
baptism by water.</p>

<p><b>15.</b> The apostles of old promised the ministration of
the Holy Ghost unto those only who had received baptism
by water for the remission of sins;<a name="FNanchor_491_491" id="FNanchor_491_491"></a><a href="#Footnote_491_491" class="fnanchor">[491]</a> John the Baptist gave
assurances of the visitation of the Holy Ghost to those only
who were baptized unto repentance.<a name="FNanchor_492_492" id="FNanchor_492_492"></a><a href="#Footnote_492_492" class="fnanchor">[492]</a> The instance of Paul's
rebaptizing the twelve disciples at Ephesus before he conferred
upon them the Holy Ghost, on account of a probable
lack of propriety or of authority in their first baptism,<a name="FNanchor_493_493" id="FNanchor_493_493"></a><a href="#Footnote_493_493" class="fnanchor">[493]</a> has
already been dwelt upon. We read of a remarkable manifestation
of power among the people of Samaria,<a name="FNanchor_494_494" id="FNanchor_494_494"></a><a href="#Footnote_494_494" class="fnanchor">[494]</a> to whom
Philip went and preached the Lord Jesus; the people with
one accord accepted his testimony and sought baptism.
Then came unto them Peter and John, through whose
ministrations the Holy Ghost came upon the new converts,
whereas upon none of them had the Spirit previously fallen,
though all had been baptized.</p>

<p><b>16.</b> The Holy Ghost dwells not in tabernacles unfit and
unworthy. Paul makes the sublime declaration that the
body of man when filled with the power of the Holy Ghost
becomes a temple of this spirit; and the apostle specifies the
penalty prescribed for defiling a structure sanctified by so
holy a presence.<a name="FNanchor_495_495" id="FNanchor_495_495"></a><a href="#Footnote_495_495" class="fnanchor">[495]</a> Faith in God leads to repentance of sin,
this is followed by baptism in water for the remission of
sins, and this in turn by the bestowal of the Holy Ghost,
through whose power come sanctification and the specific
gifts of God.</p>

<p><b>17. An Exception to the Prescribed Order</b> is shown in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
case of the devout Gentile, Cornelius, unto whom, together
with his family, came the Holy Ghost, with such power that
they spake with new tongues to the glorification of God,
and this before their baptism.<a name="FNanchor_496_496" id="FNanchor_496_496"></a><a href="#Footnote_496_496" class="fnanchor">[496]</a> But sufficient reason for
this departure from the usual order is seen in the prejudice
that existed among the Jews toward other nations, which,
but for the Lord's direct instructions to Peter, would have
hindered, if indeed it did not prevent, the apostle from ministering
unto the Gentiles; as it was, his act was loudly condemned
by his own people; but he answered their criticisms
with a recital of the lesson given him of God, and the undeniable
evidence of the Divine will as shown in the reception of
the Holy Ghost by Cornelius and his family before baptism.</p>

<p><b>18.</b> And in another sense the Holy Ghost has frequently
operated for good through persons that are unbaptized;
indeed, some measure of this power is given to all mankind;
for, as seen already, the Holy Spirit is the power of intelligence,
of wise direction, of development, of life. Manifestation
of the power of God, as made plain through the
operations of the Spirit, are seen in the triumphs of ennobling
art, the discoveries of true science, and the events
of history; with all of which the carnal mind may believe
that God takes no direct concern. Not a truth has ever
been made the property of human kind except through the
power of that great Spirit who exists to do the bidding of the
Father and the Son. And yet the actual companionship of
the Holy Ghost, the divinely-bestowed right to His ministrations,
the sanctifying baptism with fire, are given as a permanent
possession only to the faithful, repentant, baptized
candidate for salvation; and with all such this gift shall
abide, unless it be forfeited through transgression.</p>

<p><b>19. The Bestowal of the Holy Ghost</b> is effected through
the ordinance of an oral blessing, pronounced upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
candidate by the proper authority of the Priesthood, accompanied
by the imposition of hands by him or those officiating.
That this was the mode followed by the apostles of
old is evident from the Jewish scriptures; that it was
practiced by the early Christian Fathers is proved by history;
that it was the acknowledged method among the Nephites is
plainly shown by the Book of Mormon records; and for the
same practice in the present dispensation authority has come
direct from heaven.</p>

<p><b>20.</b> Among the instances recorded in the New Testament,
we may mention the following: Peter and John conferred
the Holy Ghost upon Philip's converts at Samaria, as
already noted, and the ordinance was performed by prayer
and the laying on of hands.<a name="FNanchor_497_497" id="FNanchor_497_497"></a><a href="#Footnote_497_497" class="fnanchor">[497]</a> Paul operated in the same
manner on the Ephesians whom he had caused to be baptized;
and "when he had laid his hands upon them, the
Holy Ghost came on them, and they spake with tongues
and prophesied."<a name="FNanchor_498_498" id="FNanchor_498_498"></a><a href="#Footnote_498_498" class="fnanchor">[498]</a> Paul also refers to this ordinance in his
admonition to Timothy not to neglect the gift so bestowed.<a name="FNanchor_499_499" id="FNanchor_499_499"></a><a href="#Footnote_499_499" class="fnanchor">[499]</a>
The same apostle, in enumerating the cardinal principles and
ordinances of the Church of Christ, includes the laying on
of hands as following baptism.<a name="FNanchor_500_500" id="FNanchor_500_500"></a><a href="#Footnote_500_500" class="fnanchor">[500]</a></p>

<p><b>21.</b> Alma so invoked the power of the Holy Ghost in
behalf of his co-laborers:<a name="FNanchor_501_501" id="FNanchor_501_501"></a><a href="#Footnote_501_501" class="fnanchor">[501]</a>&mdash;"He clapped his hands upon all
them who were with him. And behold, as he clapped his
hands upon them they were filled with the Holy Spirit."
The Savior gave authority to the twelve chosen Nephites,<a name="FNanchor_502_502" id="FNanchor_502_502"></a><a href="#Footnote_502_502" class="fnanchor">[502]</a>
by touching them one by one; they were thus commissioned
to bestow the Holy Ghost.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p><b>22.</b> In this dispensation, it has been made a duty of the
Priesthood "to confirm those who are baptized into the
Church by the laying on of hands for the baptism of fire
and the Holy Ghost."<a name="FNanchor_503_503" id="FNanchor_503_503"></a><a href="#Footnote_503_503" class="fnanchor">[503]</a> The Lord has promised that the
Holy Ghost shall follow these authoritative acts of His
servants.<a name="FNanchor_504_504" id="FNanchor_504_504"></a><a href="#Footnote_504_504" class="fnanchor">[504]</a> The ceremony of laying on of hands for the
bestowal of the Holy Ghost is associated with that of confirmation
in the Church. The officiating elder acting in
the name and by the authority of Jesus Christ, says,
"<em>Receive ye the Holy Ghost</em>;" and "<em>I confirm you a member
of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints</em>." Even
these words are not prescribed, but their meaning should be
expressed in the ceremony; and to such may be added other
words of blessing and invocation as the Spirit of the Lord
may dictate to the officiating elder. This act completes the
outward form of the baptism so indispensable to salvation&mdash;the
birth of water and of the Spirit.</p>

<p><b>23.</b> The authority to so bestow the Holy Ghost belongs
to the higher or Melchizedek Priesthood,<a name="FNanchor_505_505" id="FNanchor_505_505"></a><a href="#Footnote_505_505" class="fnanchor">[505]</a> whereas water-baptism
may be administered by a priest, officiating in the
ordinances of the lesser or Aaronic order of priesthood.<a name="FNanchor_506_506" id="FNanchor_506_506"></a><a href="#Footnote_506_506" class="fnanchor">[506]</a>
This order of authority, as made known through revelation,
explains that while Philip had authority to administer the
ordinance of baptism to the converted Samaritans, others
who held the higher priesthood had to be sent to confer
upon them the Holy Ghost.<a name="FNanchor_507_507" id="FNanchor_507_507"></a><a href="#Footnote_507_507" class="fnanchor">[507]</a></p>

<p><b>24. Gifts of the Spirit.</b>&mdash;As already pointed out, the
special office of the Holy Ghost is to enlighten and ennoble
the mind, to purify and sanctify the soul, to incite to good
works, and to reveal the things of God. But, beside these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
general blessings, there are certain specific endowments
promised in connection with the gifts of the Holy Ghost.
Said the Savior, "These signs shall follow them that believe:
In my name shall they cast out devils, they shall speak
with new tongues; they shall take up serpents; and if they
drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them: they shall lay
hands on the sick and they shall recover."<a name="FNanchor_508_508" id="FNanchor_508_508"></a><a href="#Footnote_508_508" class="fnanchor">[508]</a></p>

<p><b>25.</b> These gifts of the Spirit are distributed in the wisdom
of God for the exaltation of His children. Paul thus discourses
concerning them: "Now, concerning spiritual gifts,
brethren, I would not have you ignorant.... Now
there are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit....
But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man
to profit withal. For to one is given by the Spirit the word
of wisdom; to another the word of knowledge by the same
Spirit. To another faith by the same Spirit; to another
the gift of healing by the same Spirit. To another the
working of miracles; to another prophecy; to another discerning
of spirits; to another divers kind of tongues; to
another the interpretation of tongues. But all these worketh
that one and the selfsame Spirit, dividing to every man
severally as he will."<a name="FNanchor_509_509" id="FNanchor_509_509"></a><a href="#Footnote_509_509" class="fnanchor">[509]</a> No man is without some gift from
the Spirit; one person may possess several.</p>


<h3>NOTES.</h3>

<blockquote>

<p><b>1. Effect of the Holy Ghost on the Individual.</b>&mdash;"An intelligent being,
in the image of God, possesses every organ, attribute, sense, sympathy, affection,
of will, wisdom, love, power and gift, which is possessed by God Himself. But
these are possessed by man in his rudimental state in a subordinate sense of the
word. Or, in other words, these attributes are in embryo, and are to be gradually
developed. They resemble a bud, a germ, which gradually develops into bloom,
and then, by progress, produces the mature fruit after its own kind. The gift of the
Holy Spirit adapts itself to all these organs or attributes. It quickens all the intellectual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
faculties, increases, enlarges, expands, and purifies all the natural passions and affections,
and adapts them by the gift of wisdom, to their lawful use. It inspires, develops,
cultivates, and matures all the fine-toned sympathies, joys, tastes, kindred feelings, and
affections of our nature. It inspires virtue, kindness, goodness, tenderness, gentleness,
and charity. It develops beauty of person, form and features. It tends to health, vigor,
animation, and social feeling. It develops and invigorates all the faculties of the physical
and intellectual man. It strengthens, invigorates, and gives tone to the nerves. In
short, it is, as it were, marrow to the bone, joy to the heart, light to the eyes, music to
the ears, and life to the whole being."&mdash;Parley P. Pratt, <cite>Key to Theology</cite>, pp. 96-97
(4th ed.).</p>

<p><b>2. The Laying on of Hands.</b>&mdash;From the scriptures cited, it is plain that
the usual ceremony of bestowing the gift of the Holy Ghost consisted in part in the
imposition of hands by those in authority (Acts viii, 17; ix, 17; xix, 2-6; Alma xxxi,
36; III Nephi xviii, 36-37; Doc. and Cov. xx, 41). The same outward sign has marked
other authoritative acts: for example, ordination to the priesthood; and administration
to the sick. It is probable that Paul had reference to Timothy's ordination when he
exhorts him thus: "Neglect not the gift that is in thee, which was given thee by
prophecy, with the laying on of the hands of the presbytery" (I Tim. iv, 14). And
again, "Stir up the gift of God, which is in thee by the putting on of my hands" (II
Tim. i, 6). The first ordination to the priesthood in latter times was done by the imposition
of hands by John the Baptist (Doc. and Cov. xiii). That Christ in healing the sick
sometimes laid His hands upon the afflicted ones is certain (Mark vi, 5); and He left with
His apostles a promise that healing should follow the authoritative laying on of hands
(Mark xvi, 15, 18). The same promise has been repeated in this day (Doc. and Cov. xlii,
43-44). Yet, notwithstanding the importance given to this sign of authority, the laying
on of hands is but exceptional among the practices of the many sects professing Christianity
to-day.</p>

<p><b>3. Operation of the Holy Ghost.</b>&mdash;The means through which the Holy Ghost
operates are no more truly the Holy Ghost in person than are the light and heat and
actinic energy of the sun, the sun itself. The influence, spirit, or power of the Holy
Ghost is that of enlightenment and progression, and this is given unto men in proportion
to their receptiveness and worthiness; but the right to the special ministrations of the
third member of the Godhead is obtainable only through compliance with the preliminary
requirements of the Gospel&mdash;faith, repentance, and baptism.</p>

<p><b>4. Mode of Conferring the Holy Ghost.</b>&mdash;Questions have arisen as to the
ceremony of confirmation and the bestowal of the Holy Ghost, particularly as to the
propriety of saying: <em>Receive ye the Holy Ghost</em>; or <em>Receive ye the Gift of the Holy Ghost.</em>.
Since the companionship of the Holy Ghost embraces all the spiritual graces and gift
in so far as such are deserved by and appropriate to the person, the Church teaches that
officiating Elders in confirming baptized candidates should use the form: <em>Receive ye the
Holy Ghost</em>.</p>

<p>In explaining the reception of the Holy Ghost by the apostles of old, the
First Presidency of the Church issued an instructive statement Feb. 5, 1916. See
<span class="smcap">Deseret News</span> of that date, and <cite>Improvement Era</cite>, March, 1916; and for excerpt from
same see "Jesus the Christ" (third and later editions), p. 720.</p></blockquote>

<h3>THE SACRAMENT OF THE LORD'S SUPPER.</h3>

<p class="center">In connection with Article 4.</p>


<p><b>1. The Sacrament.</b>&mdash;In the course of our study of the
principles and ordinances of the Gospel, as specified in the
fourth of the Articles of Faith, the subject of the sacrament
of the Lord's Supper<a name="FNanchor_510_510" id="FNanchor_510_510"></a><a href="#Footnote_510_510" class="fnanchor">[510]</a> very properly claims attention, the
observance of this ordinance being required of all who have
become members of the Church of Christ through compliance
with the requirements of faith, repentance, and
baptism by water and by the Holy Ghost.</p>

<p><b>2. Institution of the Sacrament among the Jews.</b>&mdash;The
sacrament of the Lord's Supper dates from the night of the
Passover feast<a name="FNanchor_511_511" id="FNanchor_511_511"></a><a href="#Footnote_511_511" class="fnanchor">[511]</a> immediately preceding the crucifixion of
the Savior. On that solemn occasion, Christ and His apostles
were assembled in Jerusalem, keeping the feast in an upper
room, which had been made ready by His express command.<a name="FNanchor_512_512" id="FNanchor_512_512"></a><a href="#Footnote_512_512" class="fnanchor">[512]</a>
As a Jew, Christ appears to have been ever loyal to
the established usages of His people; and it must have been
with most extraordinary feelings that He entered upon this
commemorative feast, the last of its kind bearing the significance
of the type of a future sacrifice, as well as a reminder
of God's favor in the past. Knowing well the terrible experiences
immediately awaiting Him, He communed with the
Twelve at the paschal board in anguish of soul, prophesying
concerning His betrayal, which was soon to be accomplished
by the agency of one who there ate with Him. Then He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
took bread, and blessed it and gave it to His disciples, saying,
"Take, eat; this is my body;"<a name="FNanchor_513_513" id="FNanchor_513_513"></a><a href="#Footnote_513_513" class="fnanchor">[513]</a> "this do in remembrance
of me."<a name="FNanchor_514_514" id="FNanchor_514_514"></a><a href="#Footnote_514_514" class="fnanchor">[514]</a> Afterward, taking the cup, He blessed its contents
and administered it to them with the words, "Drink
ye all of it; for this is my blood of the new testament,
which is shed for many for the remission of sins."<a name="FNanchor_515_515" id="FNanchor_515_515"></a><a href="#Footnote_515_515" class="fnanchor">[515]</a> It is
interesting to note that the account of the sacrament and its
purport as given by Paul<a name="FNanchor_516_516" id="FNanchor_516_516"></a><a href="#Footnote_516_516" class="fnanchor">[516]</a> resembles so closely as to be
almost identical with the descriptions recorded by the evangelists.
The designation of the Sacrament as the Lord's
Supper is used by no biblical writer other than Paul.</p>

<p><b>3. Institution of the Sacrament among the Nephites.</b>&mdash;On
the occasion of His visit to the Nephites, which occurred
shortly after His resurrection, Christ established
the sacrament among this division of His flock. He requested
the disciples whom He had chosen to bring Him
bread and wine; then taking the bread, He brake it, blessed
it, and gave it to the disciples with the command that they
should eat and afterward distribute to the people. The
authority to administer this ordinance He promised to leave
with the people. "And this shall ye always observe to do,"
said He, "even as I have done.... And this shall
ye do in remembrance of my body, which I have shewn
unto you. And it shall be a testimony unto the Father
that ye do always remember me. And if ye do always remember
me, ye shall have my Spirit to be with you."<a name="FNanchor_517_517" id="FNanchor_517_517"></a><a href="#Footnote_517_517" class="fnanchor">[517]</a> The
wine was administered in the same order, first to the disciples,
then by them to the people. This also was to be part
of the standing ordinance among the people:&mdash;"And ye
shall do it in remembrance of my blood which I have shed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
for you, that ye may witness unto the Father that ye do
always remember me." Then followed a reiteration of the
great promise, "And if ye do always remember me, ye shall
have my Spirit to be with you."<a name="FNanchor_518_518" id="FNanchor_518_518"></a><a href="#Footnote_518_518" class="fnanchor">[518]</a></p>

<p><b>4. Fit Partakers of the Sacrament.</b>&mdash;The Divine instructions
concerning the sacredness of this ordinance are very
explicit; and the consequent need of scrupulous care being
exercised lest it be engaged in unworthily is apparent. In
addressing the Corinthian Saints, Paul utters solemn warnings
against hasty or unworthy action in partaking of the
sacrament, and declares that the penalties of sickness, and
even death, are visited upon those who violate the sacred
requirements.&mdash;"For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink
this cup, ye do shew the Lord's death till he come. Wherefore
whosoever shall eat this bread, and drink this cup of the
Lord, unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and blood of
the Lord. But let a man examine himself, and so let him
eat of that bread, and drink of that cup. For he that
eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh damnation
to himself, not discerning the Lord's body. For this
cause many are weak and sickly among you, and many
sleep."<a name="FNanchor_519_519" id="FNanchor_519_519"></a><a href="#Footnote_519_519" class="fnanchor">[519]</a></p>

<p><b>5.</b> When instructing the Nephites, Jesus laid great stress
upon the fitness of those who partook of the sacrament; and
moreover He placed much responsibility upon the officers of
the Church whose duty it was to administer it, that they
should permit none whom they knew to be unworthy to
take part in the ordinance:&mdash;"And now behold, this is the
commandment which I give unto you, that ye shall not
suffer any one knowingly to partake of my flesh and blood
unworthily, when ye shall minister it; for whoso eateth and
drinketh my flesh and blood unworthily, eateth and drinketh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
damnation to his soul; therefore, if ye know that a man is
unworthy to eat and drink of my flesh and blood, ye shall
forbid him."<a name="FNanchor_520_520" id="FNanchor_520_520"></a><a href="#Footnote_520_520" class="fnanchor">[520]</a></p>

<p><b>6.</b> The direct word of the Lord unto the Saints in this
dispensation instructs them to permit no one who has committed
trespass to partake of the sacrament until reconciliation
has been made; nevertheless the Saints are commanded
to exercise abundant charity toward their erring
fellows, not casting them out from the assemblies, yet carefully
withholding the sacrament from them.<a name="FNanchor_521_521" id="FNanchor_521_521"></a><a href="#Footnote_521_521" class="fnanchor">[521]</a> In our system
of Church organization, the local ecclesiastical officers are
charged with the responsibility of administering the sacrament,
and the people are required to keep themselves
worthy to partake of the sacred emblems.</p>

<p><b>7.</b> There is an entire absence of scriptural sanction for
giving the sacrament to any who are not members in full
fellowship in the Church of Christ. Christ administered
the ordinance on the eastern continent to His apostles only;
and we have record of their giving it to those only who had
assumed the name of Christ. Amongst His western fold,
Christ established the law that only the actual members of
His Church should partake. In promising to ordain one
among them with power to officiate in the sacrament, the
Savior specified that the one so chosen should give it unto
the people of His Church, unto all those who believed and
were baptized in His name.<a name="FNanchor_522_522" id="FNanchor_522_522"></a><a href="#Footnote_522_522" class="fnanchor">[522]</a> Only those indeed who had
been so baptized were called the Church of Christ.<a name="FNanchor_523_523" id="FNanchor_523_523"></a><a href="#Footnote_523_523" class="fnanchor">[523]</a> Continuing
His instructions to the disciples concerning the
sacrament, the Savior said: "This shall ye always do to
those who repent and are baptized in my name."<a name="FNanchor_524_524" id="FNanchor_524_524"></a><a href="#Footnote_524_524" class="fnanchor">[524]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>

<p><b>8.</b> And the same law is applicable to-day; it is the
members of the Church<a name="FNanchor_525_525" id="FNanchor_525_525"></a><a href="#Footnote_525_525" class="fnanchor">[525]</a> who are admonished to meet
together often for the observance of the sacrament; and
the Church comprises none of mature years who have
not been baptized by the authority of the Holy Priesthood.<a name="FNanchor_526_526" id="FNanchor_526_526"></a><a href="#Footnote_526_526" class="fnanchor">[526]</a></p>

<p><b>9. Purpose of the Sacrament.</b>&mdash;From the scriptural
references already made, it is plain that the sacrament is
administered to commemorate the atonement of the Lord
Jesus, as consummated in His agony and death; it is a
testimony before God, that we are mindful of His Son's sacrifice
made in our behalf; and that we still profess the name of
Christ and are determined to strive to keep His commandments,
in the hope that we may ever have His Spirit to be
with us. Partaking of the sacrament worthily may be
regarded therefore as a means of renewing our covenants
before the Lord, of acknowledgment of mutual fellowship
among the members, and of solemnly witnessing our claim
and profession of membership in the Church of Christ.
The sacrament has not been established as a specific means
of securing remission of sins; nor for any other special
blessing, aside from that of a fresh endowment of the Holy
Spirit, which, however, comprises all needful blessings.
Were the sacrament ordained for the remission of sins, it
would not be forbidden to those who are in greatest need of
special forgiveness; yet participation in the ordinance is
restricted to those whose consciences are void of serious
offense, those, therefore, who are acceptable before the
Lord; those indeed who are in as little need of special forgiveness
as mortals can be.</p>

<p><b>10. The Sacramental Emblems.</b>&mdash;In instituting the sacrament
among both the Jews and the Nephites, Christ used<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
bread and wine as the emblems of His body and blood;<a name="FNanchor_527_527" id="FNanchor_527_527"></a><a href="#Footnote_527_527" class="fnanchor">[527]</a> and
in this, the dispensation of the fulness of times, He has
revealed His will that the Saints meet together often to
partake of bread and wine in this commemorative ordinance.<a name="FNanchor_528_528" id="FNanchor_528_528"></a><a href="#Footnote_528_528" class="fnanchor">[528]</a>
But the Lord has also shown that other forms of food and
drink may be used in place of bread and wine. Very soon
after the Church was organized in the present dispensation,
the Prophet Joseph was about to purchase some wine for
sacramental purposes, when a special messenger from God
appeared to him, and delivered the following instructions:
"For, behold, I say unto you, that it mattereth not what ye
shall eat, or what ye shall drink, when ye partake of the
sacrament, if it so be that ye do it with an eye single to my
glory; remembering unto the Father my body which was
laid down for you, and my blood which was shed for the
remission of your sins. Wherefore, a commandment I give
unto you, that you shall not purchase wine, neither strong
drink, of your enemies: Wherefore you shall partake of
none except it is made new among you; yea in this my
Father's kingdom which shall be built up upon the earth."<a name="FNanchor_529_529" id="FNanchor_529_529"></a><a href="#Footnote_529_529" class="fnanchor">[529]</a>
Upon this authority, the Latter-day Saints administer water
in their sacramental service, in preference to wine concerning
the purity of which they are not assured. However, in
the vineyard districts of the Church territory, wine has
been generally used.</p>

<p><b>11. Manner of Administering the Sacrament.</b>&mdash;It is customary
with the Latter-day Saints in all wards or regularly
organized branches of the Church, to hold sacramental
meetings every Sabbath. The authority of the priest of the
Aaronic order of priesthood is requisite in consecrating
the emblems; and, as a matter of course, any one holding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
the higher order of priesthood has authority to officiate in
this ordinance. The bread is first to be broken into small
pieces, and placed in suitable receptacles on the sacramental
table; and then, according to the Lord's direction, the elder
or priest shall administer it, after this manner:&mdash;"He shall
kneel with the Church and call upon the Father in solemn
prayer, saying:&mdash;</p>

<p>"<em>O God, the Eternal Father, we ask thee in the name of
thy Son, Jesus Christ, to bless and sanctify this bread to the
souls of all those who partake of it, that they may eat in remembrance
of the body of thy Son, and witness unto thee, O
God, the Eternal Father, that they are willing to take upon
them the name of thy Son, and always remember him, and
keep his commandments which he has given them, that they
may always have his Spirit to be with them. Amen.</em>"<a name="FNanchor_530_530" id="FNanchor_530_530"></a><a href="#Footnote_530_530" class="fnanchor">[530]</a></p>

<p><b>12.</b> After the bread has been distributed to the congregation,
in which labor the teachers and deacons may take part,
under the direction of the officiating priest, the wine or
water is consecrated in this manner:&mdash;</p>

<p>"<em>O God, the Eternal Father, we ask thee, in the name of
thy Son, Jesus Christ, to bless and sanctify this wine [or
water] to the souls of all those who drink of it, that they may
do it in remembrance of the blood of thy Son, which was shed
for them; that they may witness unto thee, O God, the
Eternal Father, that they do always remember him, that they
may have his Spirit to be with them. Amen.</em>"<a name="FNanchor_531_531" id="FNanchor_531_531"></a><a href="#Footnote_531_531" class="fnanchor">[531]</a></p>

<p><b>13.</b> The plainness of the Lord's instructions to the Saints
regarding this ordinance, leaves no excuse for disputation
concerning the ceremony, for assuredly no one who officiates
in these holy rites can feel that he is authorized to change
the forms even by the alteration of a word. If ever the
Lord desires a change in this ordinance, He will doubtless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
make it known through His established channels of the
priesthood. The records of the Nephites clearly prove that
the manner of administering the sacrament as practiced in
their day,<a name="FNanchor_532_532" id="FNanchor_532_532"></a><a href="#Footnote_532_532" class="fnanchor">[532]</a> was the same as revealed for the guidance of the
Saints in the dispensation of the fulness of times.</p>

<h3>NOTES.</h3>


<blockquote>

<p><b>1. The Term "Sacrament"</b> is commonly used in both a general and a specific
sense; according to its derivation, it signifies a sacred thing or holy ceremony, and with
this meaning it is applied by different sects to several ceremonies of their churches.
Thus, the Protestants speak of two sacraments,&mdash;baptism and the Lord's Supper; the
Roman and Greek Catholics recognize seven sacraments,&mdash;the two named above, and also
confirmation, matrimony, the bestowal of church orders, penance, and extreme unction.
Some sections of the Greek church are said to exclude confirmation and extreme unction
from among the seven sacraments. With even greater latitude, the term is applied to
any miraculous or spiritual manifestation; it is so used by Bishop Jeremy Taylor when
he says, "God sometime sent a light of fire, and pillar of a cloud ... and the
sacrament of a rainbow, to guide His people through their portion of sorrows." Specifically,
however, the word sacrament denotes the Lord's Supper, and in this sense alone
does the word occur in Latter-day Saint theology. Eucharist and Holy Communion are
terms employed in certain churches as synonymous with the sacrament of the Lord's
supper. From the custom of regarding the ceremony of communion, that is, the partaking
of the sacrament, as an evidence of standing in any church, and from the rule which
withholds this privilege from those who are judged to be unworthy of fellowship, comes
the term <em>excommunicate</em>, as applied to deprivation of church fellowship, meaning literally
to cast out from communion.</p>

<p><b>2. The Lord's Supper.</b>&mdash;As stated, this designation of the sacrament occurs
but once in the Bible. The "Lord's Supper" is referred to by Paul in his first epistle to
the Corinthians. In all probability this name was used because the rite was first administered
at the time of the evening meal. It must be remembered that the <i lang="el" xml:lang="el">deipnon</i> or
evening supper among the Jews was the principal meal of the day, and really corresponded
to our dinner.</p>

<p><b>3. The Passover and the Sacrament.</b>&mdash;The feast of the passover was the
chief of the annual ceremonials of the Jews, and derived its name from the circumstances
of its origin. In setting His hand to deliver Israel from the bondage of Egypt, the Lord
wrought many miracles and wonders before Pharaoh and his idolatrous house; and, as
the last of the ten terrible plagues to which the Egyptians were subjected, the first born
of every household was smitten with death during a single night. By previous command,
the Israelites had marked the posts and lintels of their doorways with the blood of a
lamb slain for the occasion, the blood having been sprinkled by means of a bunch of
hyssop. In His passage through the land, the Lord passed over the houses so marked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
(Exodus xii, 12, 13); while in all the Egyptian homes the stroke of death was felt.
Hence arises the name Passover, from <i lang="el" xml:lang="el">pasach</i>&mdash;to pass by. The flesh of the paschal
lamb was eaten amid the haste of departure. To commemorate their deliverance from
bondage, the Lord required of the Israelites an annual celebration of this event, the occasion
being known as the "Feast of the Passover," also as the "Feast of Unleavened
Bread," the latter name arising from the Lord's command that during the specified time
of the observance no leaven should be found in the houses of the people (Ex. xii, 15);
and the occasion of the feast was to be taken advantage of for instructing the children
concerning the merciful dealings of God with their forefathers (Ex. xii, 26. 27). But
aside from its commemorative purpose, the passover became to the people a type of the
sacrifice on Calvary. Paul says, "Christ, our passover, is sacrificed for us" (I Cor. v, 7).
As being typical of the future atoning death of Christ, the passover lost part of its significance
by the crucifixion, and was superseded by the sacrament. There is perhaps no
closer relation between the two ordinances than this. Surely the sacrament was not
designed to fully supplant the passover, for the latter was established as a perpetually
recurring feast:&mdash;"And the day shall be unto you for a memorial: and ye shall keep it a
feast to the Lord throughout your generations; ye shall keep it a feast by an ordinance
forever" (Ex. xii, 14).</p>

<p><b>4. Errors Concerning the Sacrament</b>, and its signification, and the manner
of administering it, grew rapidly in the professed-Christian churches during the
early centuries of the Christian era. As soon as the power of the priesthood had departed,
much disputation arose in matters of ordinance, and the observance of the
sacrament became distorted. Theological teachers strove to foster the idea that there
was much mystery attending this naturally simple and most impressive ordinance; that
all who were not in full communion with the Church should be excluded, not only from
participation in the ordinance, which was justifiable, but from the privilege of witnessing
the service, lest they profane the mystic rite by their unhallowed presence. Then
arose the heresy of transubstantiation,&mdash;which held that the sacramental emblems by
the ceremony of consecration lost their natural character of simple bread and wine, and
became in reality flesh and blood,&mdash;actually parts of the crucified body of Christ. Argument
against such dogmas is useless. Then followed the veneration of the emblems by
the people, the bread and wine&mdash;regarded as part of Christ's tabernacle, being elevated
in the mass for the adoration of the people; and later, the custom of suppressing half of
the sacrament was introduced. By the innovation last mentioned, only the bread was
administered, the dogmatic assertion being that both the body and the blood were represented
in some mystical way in one of the "elements." Certain it is, that Christ required
his disciples to both eat and drink in remembrance of Him.</p>

<p><b>5. Sacrament Administered to Unbaptized Children.</b>&mdash;Questions have
been raised as to the propriety of administering the sacrament to children below the age
specified as that of baptism into the Church. As indicated in a preceding lecture (pp.
127-130), children born in the Church are members thereof without baptism until they
arrive at the age of accountability. There is seemingly no violation of law in administering
the sacrament to such innocent subjects, and as the living authorities of the Church
have directed the practice, the question of propriety is answered. Nevertheless, children
should be taught that after they have been baptized and confirmed in the Church, the
partaking of the sacrament has to them an added significance, in that it marks a renewal
of the covenants they made at the waters of baptism.</p></blockquote>

<h3>AUTHORITY IN THE MINISTRY.</h3>

<blockquote>

<p><b>Article 5.</b>&mdash;We believe that a man must be called of God, by prophecy and by the
laying on of hands by those who are in authority, to preach the Gospel, and administer
in the ordinances thereof.</p></blockquote>


<p class="center">MEN CALLED OF GOD.</p>

<p><b>1. Scriptural Examples.</b>&mdash;It is not less agreeable to the
dictates of human reason, than it is conformable to the
plan of perfect organization which characterizes the Church
of Christ, that all who minister in the ordinances of the
Gospel should be called and commissioned for their sacred
duties by the authority of heaven. The scriptures sustain
this view most thoroughly; they present to us an array of
men whose Divine callings are specially attested, and whose
mighty works declare a power greater than that of man.
On the other hand, not an instance is set down in holy writ
of anyone taking to himself the authority to officiate in
sacred ordinances, and being acknowledged of the Lord in
such administration.</p>

<p><b>2.</b> Consider the case of Noah, who "found grace in the
eyes of the Lord"<a name="FNanchor_533_533" id="FNanchor_533_533"></a><a href="#Footnote_533_533" class="fnanchor">[533]</a> in the midst of a wicked world. Unto
him the Lord spake, announcing His displeasure with the
wicked inhabitants of earth, and the Divine intention concerning
the deluge; and instructed him in the manner of
building and stocking the ark. That Noah declared the
word of God unto his perverse contemporaries is shown in
Peter's declaration of Christ's mission in the spirit world,&mdash;that
the Savior preached to those who had been disobedient
during the period of God's long suffering in the days of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
Noah, and who had in consequence endured the privations
of the prison house in the interval.<a name="FNanchor_534_534" id="FNanchor_534_534"></a><a href="#Footnote_534_534" class="fnanchor">[534]</a> Surely none can
question the Divine source of Noah's authority, nor the
justice of the retributive punishment following the wilful
rejection of his teachings, for his words were the words of
God.</p>

<p><b>3.</b> So also with Abraham, the father of the faithful; the
Lord called him<a name="FNanchor_535_535" id="FNanchor_535_535"></a><a href="#Footnote_535_535" class="fnanchor">[535]</a> and made covenant with him for all the
generations of his posterity. Isaac<a name="FNanchor_536_536" id="FNanchor_536_536"></a><a href="#Footnote_536_536" class="fnanchor">[536]</a> was similarly distinguished;
likewise Jacob,<a name="FNanchor_537_537" id="FNanchor_537_537"></a><a href="#Footnote_537_537" class="fnanchor">[537]</a> to whom, as he rested upon his
pillow of stones in the desert, the Lord appeared. Unto
Moses<a name="FNanchor_538_538" id="FNanchor_538_538"></a><a href="#Footnote_538_538" class="fnanchor">[538]</a> came the voice of God amidst the fierceness of fire,
calling and commissioning the man to go into Egypt and
deliver therefrom the people whose cries had come up with
such effect before the throne of heaven. In this great work
Aaron<a name="FNanchor_539_539" id="FNanchor_539_539"></a><a href="#Footnote_539_539" class="fnanchor">[539]</a> was called to assist his brother; and later, Aaron and
his sons<a name="FNanchor_540_540" id="FNanchor_540_540"></a><a href="#Footnote_540_540" class="fnanchor">[540]</a> were chosen by Divine direction from the midst of
the children of Israel to minister in the priest's office. When
Moses<a name="FNanchor_541_541" id="FNanchor_541_541"></a><a href="#Footnote_541_541" class="fnanchor">[541]</a> saw that his days were numbered, he solicited the
Lord to appoint a successor in his holy station; and by
special command, Joshua, the son of Nun, was so selected.</p>

<p><b>4.</b> Samuel, who became so great a prophet in Israel,
commissioned to consecrate, command, and rebuke kings, to
direct armies, and to serve as the oracle of God unto the
people, was chosen while yet a boy, and called by the voice
of the Lord.<a name="FNanchor_542_542" id="FNanchor_542_542"></a><a href="#Footnote_542_542" class="fnanchor">[542]</a> And such was the power that followed this
call, that all Israel from Dan to Beersheba knew that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
Samuel was established a prophet of the Lord.<a name="FNanchor_543_543" id="FNanchor_543_543"></a><a href="#Footnote_543_543" class="fnanchor">[543]</a> Time fails
to permit the mention of many other men of might, who
received their power from God, whose histories portray the
honor with which the Lord regarded His chosen ministers.
Think of the heavenly vision by which Isaiah was called and
directed in the duties of his prophetic office;<a name="FNanchor_544_544" id="FNanchor_544_544"></a><a href="#Footnote_544_544" class="fnanchor">[544]</a> of Jeremiah,
to whom the word of the Lord came in the days of Josiah;<a name="FNanchor_545_545" id="FNanchor_545_545"></a><a href="#Footnote_545_545" class="fnanchor">[545]</a>
of the priest Ezekiel, who first received the Divine message
in the land of the Chaldeans,<a name="FNanchor_546_546" id="FNanchor_546_546"></a><a href="#Footnote_546_546" class="fnanchor">[546]</a> and subsequently on other
occasions; of Hosea,<a name="FNanchor_547_547" id="FNanchor_547_547"></a><a href="#Footnote_547_547" class="fnanchor">[547]</a> and all the rest of the prophets to
Zechariah<a name="FNanchor_548_548" id="FNanchor_548_548"></a><a href="#Footnote_548_548" class="fnanchor">[548]</a> and Malachi.<a name="FNanchor_549_549" id="FNanchor_549_549"></a><a href="#Footnote_549_549" class="fnanchor">[549]</a></p>

<p><b>5.</b> The apostles of the Lord were called by His own
voice in the days of His ministry; and surely the Savior's
authority is beyond question, vindicated as it is by the
mighty works of the atonement, wrought through pain and
the anguish of death, and by the authoritative declaration
of the Father at the time of Christ's baptism. Peter, and
Andrew his brother, while casting their nets into the sea,
were called with the instruction,&mdash;"Follow me, and I will
make you fishers of men;"<a name="FNanchor_550_550" id="FNanchor_550_550"></a><a href="#Footnote_550_550" class="fnanchor">[550]</a> and soon after, James and John,
the sons of Zebedee, were similarly called. So with all of
the chosen Twelve who ministered with the Master; and
unto the Eleven who had remained faithful, He appeared
after His resurrection, giving them special commissions for
the work of the kingdom.<a name="FNanchor_551_551" id="FNanchor_551_551"></a><a href="#Footnote_551_551" class="fnanchor">[551]</a> Christ specifically declares that
He had chosen His apostles, and that He had ordained them
in their exalted stations.<a name="FNanchor_552_552" id="FNanchor_552_552"></a><a href="#Footnote_552_552" class="fnanchor">[552]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>

<p><b>6.</b> In the period immediately following that of Christ's
earthly mission, the ministers of the Gospel were all designated
and set apart by unquestionable authority. Even
Saul of Tarsus, afterward Paul the Apostle, who was converted
with marvelous signs and wondrous manifestations,<a name="FNanchor_553_553" id="FNanchor_553_553"></a><a href="#Footnote_553_553" class="fnanchor">[553]</a>
had to be formally commissioned for the labor which the
Lord desired him to perform; and we are told that the Holy
Ghost spake to the prophets and teachers of the Church at
Antioch, while they fasted before the Lord, saying, "Separate
me Barnabas and Saul for the work whereunto I have
called them."<a name="FNanchor_554_554" id="FNanchor_554_554"></a><a href="#Footnote_554_554" class="fnanchor">[554]</a></p>

<p><b>7. The Ordination of Men to the Ministry</b>, as sanctioned
by scriptural precedent, and established by direct revelation
of God's will, is to be effected through the gift of
prophecy, and by the imposition of hands by those who are
in authority. By prophecy is meant the right to receive,
and the power to interpret, manifestations of the Divine
will. That the laying on of hands is usual as a part of the
ceremony is seen in several of the instances already cited;
nevertheless the scriptures record numerous ordinations to
the offices of the priesthood, with no specific statement
concerning the imposition of hands, nor indeed any other
details of the ceremony. Such instances do not warrant
the conclusion that the laying on of hands was not actually
performed; and indeed in the light of modern revelation
it is clear that the imposition of hands was a usual accompaniment
of ordination, as it was also a part of the ceremony
of confirming blessings,<a name="FNanchor_555_555" id="FNanchor_555_555"></a><a href="#Footnote_555_555" class="fnanchor">[555]</a> and of bestowing the Holy
Ghost.<a name="FNanchor_556_556" id="FNanchor_556_556"></a><a href="#Footnote_556_556" class="fnanchor">[556]</a></p>

<p><b>8.</b> Thus, the priesthood descended from Adam to Noah,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
under the hands of the fathers;<a name="FNanchor_557_557" id="FNanchor_557_557"></a><a href="#Footnote_557_557" class="fnanchor">[557]</a> Enos was ordained by the
hand of Adam; and the same was true of Mahalaleel,
Jared, Enoch, and Methuselah. Lamech was ordained
under the hand of Seth; Noah received his authority from
the hand of Methuselah. And so may the priesthood be
traced, bestowed as the spirit of prophecy directed by the
hand of one upon another, till the time of Moses. Melchizedek,
who conferred this authority upon Abraham,
received his own through the direct lineage of his fathers,
from Noah. Esaias, a contemporary of Abraham, received
his ordination under the hand of God. Through the hand
of Esaias, the authority passed to Gad, thence by the same
means to Jeremy, Elihu, Caleb, and Jethro, the priest of
Midian, under whose hand Moses was ordained.<a name="FNanchor_558_558" id="FNanchor_558_558"></a><a href="#Footnote_558_558" class="fnanchor">[558]</a> Joshua
the son of Nun was set apart as directed of God, through
the imposition of hands by Moses.<a name="FNanchor_559_559" id="FNanchor_559_559"></a><a href="#Footnote_559_559" class="fnanchor">[559]</a></p>

<p><b>9.</b> In the days of the apostles, circumstances rendered it
expedient to appoint special officers in the Church, to care
for the poor and attend to the distribution of supplies;
these were selected with care, and were set apart through
prayer and laying on of hands.<a name="FNanchor_560_560" id="FNanchor_560_560"></a><a href="#Footnote_560_560" class="fnanchor">[560]</a> Timothy was similarly ordained,
as witness the admonitions given him by Paul:&mdash;"Neglect
not the gift that is in thee, which was given thee
by prophecy, with the laying on of the hands of the presbytery,"<a name="FNanchor_561_561" id="FNanchor_561_561"></a><a href="#Footnote_561_561" class="fnanchor">[561]</a>
and again, "Stir up the gift of God which is in thee
by the putting on of my hands."<a name="FNanchor_562_562" id="FNanchor_562_562"></a><a href="#Footnote_562_562" class="fnanchor">[562]</a> The Lord has bound
Himself by solemn covenant to acknowledge the acts of
His authorized servants. Unto whomsoever the elders give
promise after baptism the Holy Ghost will come.<a name="FNanchor_563_563" id="FNanchor_563_563"></a><a href="#Footnote_563_563" class="fnanchor">[563]</a> Whatever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
the priesthood shall bind or loose on earth, is to be similarly
bound or loosed in heaven;<a name="FNanchor_564_564" id="FNanchor_564_564"></a><a href="#Footnote_564_564" class="fnanchor">[564]</a> the sick upon whom the
elders lay their hands, are to recover;<a name="FNanchor_565_565" id="FNanchor_565_565"></a><a href="#Footnote_565_565" class="fnanchor">[565]</a> and many other signs
are to follow them that believe. And so jealous is the Lord
of the power to officiate in His name, that at the judgment,
all who have aided or persecuted His servants, are to be rewarded
or punished as if they had done those things unto
Christ Himself.<a name="FNanchor_566_566" id="FNanchor_566_566"></a><a href="#Footnote_566_566" class="fnanchor">[566]</a></p>

<p><b>10. Unauthorized Ministrations</b> in priestly functions are
not alone invalid, they are indeed grievously sinful. In His
dealings with mankind, God has ever recognized and honored
the priesthood established by His direction; and has
never countenanced any unauthorized assumption of authority.
A terrible lesson is taught in the case of Korah and
his associates, in their rebellion against the authority of the
priesthood,&mdash;in that they falsely professed the right to
minister in the priest's office. The Lord promptly visited
them for their sins, causing the ground to cleave asunder,
and to swallow them up with all their belongings.<a name="FNanchor_567_567" id="FNanchor_567_567"></a><a href="#Footnote_567_567" class="fnanchor">[567]</a></p>

<p><b>11.</b> And think of the affliction that fell upon Miriam, the
sister of Moses, a prophetess among the people.<a name="FNanchor_568_568" id="FNanchor_568_568"></a><a href="#Footnote_568_568" class="fnanchor">[568]</a> She, with
Aaron, railed against Moses, and they said, "Hath the
Lord indeed spoken only by Moses? hath He not spoken
also by us? and the Lord heard it."<a name="FNanchor_569_569" id="FNanchor_569_569"></a><a href="#Footnote_569_569" class="fnanchor">[569]</a> He came at once in a
cloud, and stood in the door of the tabernacle, denouncing
their presumption, and vindicating the authority of His
chosen oracle, Moses. When the cloud passed from the
tabernacle, Miriam was seen to be leprous, white as snow;
and according to the law, she was shut out of the camp of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
Israel. However, through the earnest entreaties of Moses,
the Lord healed the woman, and she was subsequently
permitted to return to the company.</p>

<p><b>12.</b> Consider the fate of Uzza, the Israelite who met
sudden death through the anger of God, because he put
forth his hand to steady the ark of the covenant lest it fall.<a name="FNanchor_570_570" id="FNanchor_570_570"></a><a href="#Footnote_570_570" class="fnanchor">[570]</a>
This he did in spite of the law that none but the priests
might touch the sacred accompaniments of the ark; we
read that not even the appointed bearers of the vessel were
allowed to touch its holy parts, on pain of death.<a name="FNanchor_571_571" id="FNanchor_571_571"></a><a href="#Footnote_571_571" class="fnanchor">[571]</a></p>

<p><b>13.</b> Think also of Saul the King of Israel, who had
been called from the farm to be made a monarch favored of
God. When the Philistines were marshalled against Israel
in Michmash, Saul waited for Samuel,<a name="FNanchor_572_572" id="FNanchor_572_572"></a><a href="#Footnote_572_572" class="fnanchor">[572]</a> under whose hand
he had received his kingly anointing,<a name="FNanchor_573_573" id="FNanchor_573_573"></a><a href="#Footnote_573_573" class="fnanchor">[573]</a> and to whom he had
looked in the days of his humility for guidance; he asked
that the prophet come and offer sacrifices to the Lord in
behalf of the people. But, growing impatient at Samuel's
delay, Saul prepared the burnt offering himself, forgetting
that though he occupied the throne, wore the crown, and
bore the sceptre, these insignia of kingly power gave him
no right to officiate even as a door-keeper in the house of
God; and for this and other instances of his unrighteous
presumption, he was rejected of God and another was chosen
in his place.</p>

<p><b>14.</b> A striking instance of Divine jealousy concerning
holy functions is shown in the dreadful experience of
Uzziah, king of Judah. He was placed upon the throne
when but sixteen years old; and, as long as he sought the
Lord, he was greatly prospered, so that his name became a
terror unto his enemies. But he allowed pride to grow in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
his heart, and indulged the delusion that in his kingship he
was supreme. He entered the temple and essayed to burn
incense on the altar. Shocked at his blasphemous action,
Azariah, the chief priest of the temple, and fourscore priests
with him, forbade the king, saying:&mdash;"It appertaineth
not unto thee, Uzziah, to burn incense unto the Lord,
but to the priests, the sons of Aaron, that are consecrated
to burn incense; go out of the sanctuary, for thou hast
trespassed." At this rebuke and condemnation from his
subjects, though they were priests of the living God, the
king became angry; but immediately the dread scourge of
leprosy fell upon him; the signs of the horrible disease
appeared in his forehead; and, being now physically an unclean
creature, his presence tended the more to defile the
holy place. So Azariah and his associate priests thrust the
king out from the temple, and he, a smitten thing, fled from
the house of God never again to enter its sacred precincts.
Concerning the rest of his punishment we read, "And
Uzziah the king was a leper unto the day of his death, and
dwelt in a several house, being a leper; for he was cut off
from the house of the Lord."<a name="FNanchor_574_574" id="FNanchor_574_574"></a><a href="#Footnote_574_574" class="fnanchor">[574]</a></p>

<p><b>15.</b> A forceful illustration of the futility of false ceremonies,
or of the mere form of sacred ordinances when the
authority is absent, is shown in the New Testament record
of the seven sons of Sceva. These in common with others
had seen, and had marveled at, the miraculous power exhibited
by Paul, whom the Lord so blessed in his apostleship
that through contact with handkerchiefs or aprons sent by
him the sick were healed, and their evil spirits were cast
out. Sceva's sons, who are counted by the sacred chronicler
among the exorcists and the vagabond Jews, sought also to
expel an evil spirit: "We adjure you by Jesus whom Paul
preacheth," said they; but the evil spirit derided them for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
their lack of authority, exclaiming: "Jesus I know, and
Paul I know, but who are ye?" Then the afflicted person,
in whom the evil spirit dwelt, leaped upon them and overcame
them, so that when they escaped from the house they
were naked and wounded.<a name="FNanchor_575_575" id="FNanchor_575_575"></a><a href="#Footnote_575_575" class="fnanchor">[575]</a></p>

<p><b>16. Teachers True and False.</b>&mdash;None but those who are
duly authorized to teach can be regarded as true expounders
of the word. The remarks of Paul concerning the high
priests are alike applicable to every office of the priesthood:
"No man taketh this honor to himself, but he that is called
of God, as was Aaron."<a name="FNanchor_576_576" id="FNanchor_576_576"></a><a href="#Footnote_576_576" class="fnanchor">[576]</a> And Aaron, as we have already
seen, was called through Moses unto whom the Lord revealed
His will in the matter. This authority to act in the
name of the Lord is given to those only who are chosen of
God; it is not to be had for the mere asking; it is not to
be bought with gold. We read of Simon, the sorcerer, who
coveted the power possessed by the apostles; he offered
these ministers of Christ money, saying, "Give me also this
power that on whomsoever I lay my hands he may receive
the Holy Ghost." But Peter answered him with righteous
indignation, "Thy money perish with thee, because thou
hast thought that the gift of God may be purchased with
money; thou hast neither part nor lot in this matter, for
thy heart is not right in the sight of God."<a name="FNanchor_577_577" id="FNanchor_577_577"></a><a href="#Footnote_577_577" class="fnanchor">[577]</a></p>

<p><b>17.</b> It was known to the apostles of old that men would
seek to arrogate unto themselves the right to officiate in
things divine, thus becoming servants of Satan. In addressing
a conference of the elders at Ephesus, Paul prophesied
of these ill events, and warned the shepherds of the
flock to look well to their charge.<a name="FNanchor_578_578" id="FNanchor_578_578"></a><a href="#Footnote_578_578" class="fnanchor">[578]</a> In an epistle to Timothy,
the apostle reiterates this prophecy; encouraging to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
diligence in preaching the word, he declares, "For the time
will come when they will not endure sound doctrine, but
after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers
having itching ears, and they shall turn away their ears
from the truth, and shall be turned unto fables."<a name="FNanchor_579_579" id="FNanchor_579_579"></a><a href="#Footnote_579_579" class="fnanchor">[579]</a> Peter's
declarations on the same subject are no less plain. Addressing
himself to the Saints of his time, he refers to the false
prophets of old, and adds:&mdash;"There shall be false teachers
among you, who privily shall bring in damnable heresies;
even denying the Lord that bought them.... And
many shall follow their pernicious ways, by reason of whom
the way of truth shall be evil spoken of."<a name="FNanchor_580_580" id="FNanchor_580_580"></a><a href="#Footnote_580_580" class="fnanchor">[580]</a></p>

<p><b>18. Divine Authority in the Present Dispensation.</b>&mdash;The
Latter-day Saints claim to possess authority to administer
in the name of God, and that this right has been conferred
in this day under the hands of those who held the same
power in former dispensations. That the authority of the
holy priesthood was to be taken from the earth as the
apostles of old were slain, and that it would of necessity
have to be restored from heaven before the Church could be
re-established, may be shown by scripture. On the 15th day
of May, 1829, while Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery were
engaged in earnest prayer for instruction concerning baptism
for the remission of sins, mention of which they had found
in the plates from which they were then engaged in translating
the Book of Mormon, a messenger from heaven
descended in a cloud of light. He announced himself as
John, called of old the Baptist, and said he acted under the
direction of Peter, James, and John, who held the keys of
the higher priesthood. The messenger laid his hands upon
the two young men and ordained them to authority, saying,
"Upon you my fellow servants, in the name of Messiah, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
confer the priesthood of Aaron, which holds the keys of the
ministering of angels, and of the gospel of repentance, and
of baptism by immersion for the remission of sins; and this
shall never be taken again from the earth, until the sons of
Levi do offer again an offering unto the Lord in righteousness."<a name="FNanchor_581_581" id="FNanchor_581_581"></a><a href="#Footnote_581_581" class="fnanchor">[581]</a></p>

<p><b>19.</b> A short time after this event, Peter, James, and
John appeared to Joseph and Oliver, and ordained the two
to the higher or Melchizedek priesthood, bestowing upon
them the keys of the apostleship, which these heavenly
messengers had held and exercised in the former gospel
dispensation. This order of priesthood holds authority over
all the offices in the Church, and includes power to administer
in spiritual things;<a name="FNanchor_582_582" id="FNanchor_582_582"></a><a href="#Footnote_582_582" class="fnanchor">[582]</a> consequently all the authorities and
powers necessary to the establishment of the Church were by
this visitation restored to earth.</p>

<p><b>20.</b> No one is authorized to officiate in any of the ordinances
of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints
unless he has been ordained to that calling by those holding
the power; thus, no man receives the priesthood except
under the hand of one who holds that priesthood himself;
that one must have obtained it from others previously commissioned;
and so every holder of the priesthood to-day can
trace his authority to the hands of Joseph the Prophet, who,
as already stated, received his ordination under the hands
of heavenly messengers clothed with power divine. That
men who are called of God to the authority of the ministry
on earth may have been selected for such appointment even
before they took mortal bodies is evident from the scriptures.
This matter may properly claim attention in the
present connection; and its consideration leads us to the
subjects which follow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span></p>


<p class="center">FORE-ORDINATION AND PRE-EXISTENCE.</p>

<p><b>21. Fore-ordination.</b>&mdash;In a wonderful interview with
Abraham, the Lord revealed many things ordinarily withheld
from mortal eyes. Said the patriarch:&mdash;"Now the
Lord had shewn unto me, Abraham, the intelligences that
were organized before the world was; and among all these
there were many of the noble and great ones; and God saw
these souls that they were good, and he stood in the midst
of them, and he said, These I will make my rulers; for
he stood among those that were spirits, and he saw that they
were good; and he said unto me, Abraham, thou art one of
them, thou wast chosen before thou wast born."<a name="FNanchor_583_583" id="FNanchor_583_583"></a><a href="#Footnote_583_583" class="fnanchor">[583]</a> This is
one of the many scriptural proofs that the spirits of mankind
existed prior to their earthly probation:&mdash;a condition
in which these intelligences lived and exercised their free
agency before they assumed bodily tabernacles. Surely then
the natures, dispositions, and tendencies of men are known
to the Father of their spirits, even before these beings are
born in mortality; and He needs not to wait till they develop
and prove their capacities on earth before they are appointed
to special labors in the fulfillment of Divine purposes.</p>

<p><b>22.</b> Evidence is abundant that Christ was chosen and
ordained to be the Redeemer of the world, even from the
beginning. We read of His foremost position amongst the
sons of God in offering Himself as a sacrifice to carry into
effect the will of the Father.<a name="FNanchor_584_584" id="FNanchor_584_584"></a><a href="#Footnote_584_584" class="fnanchor">[584]</a> He it was, "Who verily was

<p><b>23.</b> Paul taught the doctrine of Divine selection and
pre-appointment thus:&mdash;"For whom he did fore-know, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his
Son.... Moreover, whom he did predestinate, them
he also called."<a name="FNanchor_586_586" id="FNanchor_586_586"></a><a href="#Footnote_586_586" class="fnanchor">[586]</a> And again:&mdash;"God hath not cast away
his people which he foreknew."<a name="FNanchor_587_587" id="FNanchor_587_587"></a><a href="#Footnote_587_587" class="fnanchor">[587]</a></p>

<p><b>24.</b> Alma, the Nephite prophet, spoke of the priests who
had been ordained after the order of the Son, and added:&mdash;"And
this is the manner after which they were ordained:
being called and prepared from the foundation of the world,
according to the fore-knowledge of God, on account of their
exceeding faith and good works; in the first place being left
to choose good or evil; therefore they having chosen good,
and exercising exceeding great faith, are called with a holy
calling, yea, with that holy calling which was prepared with,
and according to, a preparatory redemption for such."<a name="FNanchor_588_588" id="FNanchor_588_588"></a><a href="#Footnote_588_588" class="fnanchor">[588]</a></p>

<p><b>25. Fore-ordination does not Imply Compulsion.</b>&mdash;The
doctrine of absolute predestination, resulting in a nullification
of man's free agency, has been advocated with various
modifications by different sects. Nevertheless, such teachings
are wholly unjustified by both the letter and the
spirit of sacred writ. God's fore-knowledge concerning the
natures and capacities of His children enables Him to see
the end of their earthly career even from the first:&mdash;"Known
unto God are all his works from the beginning of
the world."<a name="FNanchor_589_589" id="FNanchor_589_589"></a><a href="#Footnote_589_589" class="fnanchor">[589]</a> Many people have been led to regard this
fore-knowledge of God as a sure predestination whereby
souls are assigned to glory or condemnation, even before
their birth in the flesh, and independently of any merits or
demerits of their own. This heretical doctrine seeks to rob
Deity of every trait of mercy, of justice, and of pure love; it
makes the Father appear capricious and selfish, directing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
and creating all things for His own glory alone, caring
not for the consequent suffering of the victims of His
injustice. How dreadful, how inconsistent is such an idea
of God! It leads to the absurd conclusion that the mere
knowledge of coming events must act as a determining influence
in bringing about those occurrences. God's knowledge
of spiritual and of human nature enables Him to
conclude with certainty as to the actions of any of His
children under given conditions; yet such knowledge has
surely no determining effect upon the creature.<a name="FNanchor_590_590" id="FNanchor_590_590"></a><a href="#Footnote_590_590" class="fnanchor">[590]</a></p>

<p><b>26.</b> Doubtless He knows of some spirits that they await
only the opportunity of choice between good and evil to
choose the latter and to accomplish their own destruction;
these are they as spoken of by Jude, "who were before of
old ordained to this condemnation."<a name="FNanchor_591_591" id="FNanchor_591_591"></a><a href="#Footnote_591_591" class="fnanchor">[591]</a> To avert the fate of
such, their free agency would have to be taken away; they
can be saved by force alone; and compulsion is forbidden
by the laws of heaven, for salvation and for condemnation
alike. There are others whose integrity and faithfulness
have been demonstrated in their pristine state; the Father
knows how unreservedly they may be trusted, and many of
them are called even in their mortal youth to special and
exalted labors as chosen servants of the Most High.</p>

<p><b>27. Pre-existence of Spirits.</b>&mdash;The facts already presented
concerning fore-ordination furnish proof that the spirits of
mankind passed through a stage of existence prior to the
earthly probation. This antemortal period is oft-times
spoken of as the stage of "primeval childhood" or "first
estate." That these spirits existed as organized intelligences,
and exercised their free agency during that primeval
stage, is clear from the declaration of the Lord to Abraham:&mdash;"And
they who keep their first estate shall be added upon,
and they who keep not their first estate shall not have glory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
in the same kingdom with those who keep their first estate;
and they who keep their second estate shall have glory
added upon their heads forever and ever."<a name="FNanchor_592_592" id="FNanchor_592_592"></a><a href="#Footnote_592_592" class="fnanchor">[592]</a></p>

<p><b>28.</b> No Christian doubts the pre-existence of the Savior,
or questions His position as one of the Godhead before He
came to earth as Mary's Son. The common interpretation
given to the opening words of John's Gospel sustains the
view of Christ's primeval God-ship:&mdash;"In the beginning
was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word
was God." We read further, "And the Word was made
flesh and dwelt among us."<a name="FNanchor_593_593" id="FNanchor_593_593"></a><a href="#Footnote_593_593" class="fnanchor">[593]</a> The sayings of the Redeemer
Himself support this truth. When His disciples dissented
concerning His doctrine of Himself, He said, "What and if
ye shall see the Son of man ascend up where he was before?"<a name="FNanchor_594_594" id="FNanchor_594_594"></a><a href="#Footnote_594_594" class="fnanchor">[594]</a>
On another occasion He spoke in this wise:&mdash;"I
came forth from the Father, and am come into the world;
again, I leave the world and go to the Father."<a name="FNanchor_595_595" id="FNanchor_595_595"></a><a href="#Footnote_595_595" class="fnanchor">[595]</a> And His
disciples, pleased with this plain declaration confirming the
belief which, perchance, they already entertained at heart,
rejoined, "Lo, now speakest thou plainly, and speakest no
proverb ... by this we believe that thou camest
forth from God."<a name="FNanchor_596_596" id="FNanchor_596_596"></a><a href="#Footnote_596_596" class="fnanchor">[596]</a> To the wicked Jews who boasted of
their descent from Abraham, and sought to hide their sins
under the protecting mantle of the great patriarch's name,
the Savior declared:&mdash;"Verily, verily, I say unto you, Before
Abraham was, I am."<a name="FNanchor_597_597" id="FNanchor_597_597"></a><a href="#Footnote_597_597" class="fnanchor">[597]</a> In a solemn prayer to His
Father, the Son implored, "And now, O Father, glorify
thou me with thine own self, with the glory which I had
with thee before the world was."<a name="FNanchor_598_598" id="FNanchor_598_598"></a><a href="#Footnote_598_598" class="fnanchor">[598]</a> Yet Christ was born a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
child among mortals; and it is fair to infer, that if His
earthly birth was the union of a pre-existent or antemortal
spirit with a mortal body, such also is the birth of every
member of the human family.</p>

<p><b>29.</b> But we are not left to mere inference on a basis of
analogy only; the scriptures plainly teach that the spirits of
mankind are known and numbered unto God before their
earthly advent. In his farewell administration to Israel
Moses sang, "Remember the days of old.... When
the Most High divided to the nations their inheritance,
when he separated the sons of Adam, he set the bounds of
the people according to the number of the children of
Israel."<a name="FNanchor_599_599" id="FNanchor_599_599"></a><a href="#Footnote_599_599" class="fnanchor">[599]</a> From this we learn that the earth was allotted to
the nations, according to the number of the children of
Israel; it is evident therefore that the number was known
prior to the existence of the Israelitish nation in the flesh;
this is most easily explained on the assumption of a previous
existence in which the spirits of the future nation were
known.</p>

<p><b>30.</b> No chance is possible therefore in the number or
extent of the temporal creations of God.<a name="FNanchor_600_600" id="FNanchor_600_600"></a><a href="#Footnote_600_600" class="fnanchor">[600]</a> The population
of the earth is fixed according to the number of spirits appointed
to take tabernacles of flesh upon this sphere; when
these have all come forth in the order and time decreed of
God, then, and not till then, shall the end come.</p>
<h3>NOTES.</h3>



<blockquote>

<p><b>1. Spiritual Creations.</b>&mdash;The pre-existent condition is not characteristic of human
souls alone; all things of earth have a spiritual being, of which the temporal structure
forms but the counterpart. We read of the creation of "every plant of the field before
it was in the earth, and every herb of the field before it grew" (Gen. ii, 5). This is set
forth with greater fulness in another revelation to Moses:&mdash;"These are the generations
of the heaven and the earth when they were created, in the day that I, the Lord God,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
made the heaven and the earth, and every plant of the earth before it was in the earth,
and every herb of the field before it grew. For I, the Lord God, created all things of
which I have spoken, spiritually, before they were naturally upon the face of the earth....
And I, the Lord God, had created all the children of men, and not yet a man to
till the ground; for in heaven created I them; and there was not yet flesh upon the
earth, neither in the water, neither in the air: but I, the Lord God, spake, and there went
up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole face of the ground. And I, the Lord
God, formed man from the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath
of life; and man became a living soul, the first flesh upon the earth, the first man also;
nevertheless, all things were before created, but spiritually were they created and made
according to my word."&mdash;(Pearl of Great Price: Moses iii, 4-7.)</p>

<p><b>2. Authority Given of God.</b>&mdash;"The most comprehensive evidence that Joseph
Smith received the authority and power of the Holy Priesthood, is that the works of
John the Baptist, of Jesus and His apostles, are being again done on the earth by his
administration. To receive the powers of this Priesthood, it is necessary that men
should obey the laws and ordinances of the Gospel. The Lord has personally appeared
to some men, and covenanted with them as He did with Abraham (see Gen. xii, 1-3;
xiii, 14-17). The Lord also personally called and authorized His twelve Jewish apostles.
So fully were they authorized to labor for Him, and act in His name, that He said to
them: 'He that receiveth you receiveth me; and he that receiveth me receiveth him that
sent me' (Matt. x, 40). More generally, it is from the prophets and apostles of Christ
that men receive the Priesthood. Many received it under the hands of the apostles of
the first Gospel dispensation. Those who have received it in this latter-day dispensation,
have received it from Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery; and, in doing so, have received
it through a legitimate channel from God the Father and His Son Jesus Christ. Those
who have received this Priesthood have covenanted with God the Father, and He with
them. This is evidently the view taken of the subject in the above passage quoted from
Matthew. The doctrine is more fully illustrated in Doc. and Cov.: 'All they who receive
this Priesthood receiveth me, saith the Lord; for he that receiveth my servants receiveth
me; and he that receiveth me receiveth my Father; and he that receiveth my Father,
receiveth my Father's kingdom; therefore all that my Father hath shall be given unto
him, and this is according to the oath and covenant which belongeth to the Priesthood'
(Doc. and Cov. lxxxiv, 35-39)."&mdash;<cite>Compendium</cite>, F. D. Richards and J. A. Little, p. 67.</p>

<p><b>3. Fore-ordination.</b>&mdash;"'Known unto God are all his works from the beginning
of the world' (Acts xv, 18). The knowledge that we have of the beginning of the world
is principally derived from the history of its creation in the Bible Genesis, and in the
writings of Moses and of Abraham, as given in the Pearl of Great Price.... These
writings make it plain that man existed in a spiritual condition prior to coming here, and
also quite as evident that in that pre-existence he exercised his free agency....
God may have called and chosen men in their first estate, or spiritual existence, but
whether they will accept that call and fill it, by repentance and good works in this
life, is a matter in which it is their privilege to exercise their free agency.... Men
exercised their free agency in the first or spiritual estate, as well as in this. That the
character of their works in that estate shaped their destiny in this is evident."&mdash;<cite>Compendium</cite>,

<p class="center">THE CHURCH IN FORMER AND LATTER DAYS.</p>

<p><b>1. The Primitive Church.</b>&mdash;In the dispensation of the
Savior's ministry, Christ established His Church upon the
earth, appointing therein the officers necessary for the carrying
out of the Father's purposes. As shown in the last lecture,
every person so appointed was divinely commissioned
with authority to officiate in the ordinances of his calling;
and, after Christ's ascension, the same organization was continued,
those who had received authority ordaining others
to the various offices of the priesthood. In this way were
given unto the Church, apostles, prophets, evangelists,
pastors,<a name="FNanchor_601_601" id="FNanchor_601_601"></a><a href="#Footnote_601_601" class="fnanchor">[601]</a> high priests,<a name="FNanchor_602_602" id="FNanchor_602_602"></a><a href="#Footnote_602_602" class="fnanchor">[602]</a> seventies,<a name="FNanchor_603_603" id="FNanchor_603_603"></a><a href="#Footnote_603_603" class="fnanchor">[603]</a> elders,<a name="FNanchor_604_604" id="FNanchor_604_604"></a><a href="#Footnote_604_604" class="fnanchor">[604]</a> bishops,<a name="FNanchor_605_605" id="FNanchor_605_605"></a><a href="#Footnote_605_605" class="fnanchor">[605]</a> priests,<a name="FNanchor_606_606" id="FNanchor_606_606"></a><a href="#Footnote_606_606" class="fnanchor">[606]</a>
teachers,<a name="FNanchor_607_607" id="FNanchor_607_607"></a><a href="#Footnote_607_607" class="fnanchor">[607]</a> and deacons.<a name="FNanchor_608_608" id="FNanchor_608_608"></a><a href="#Footnote_608_608" class="fnanchor">[608]</a></p>

<p><b>2.</b> Besides these specific offices in the priesthood, there
were other callings of a more temporal nature, to which
men were also set apart by authority: such for instance was
the case of the seven men of honest report who, in the
days of the apostles, were chosen and appointed to minister
to the poor, thus leaving the Twelve freer to attend to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
particular duties of their office.<a name="FNanchor_609_609" id="FNanchor_609_609"></a><a href="#Footnote_609_609" class="fnanchor">[609]</a> This special appointment
illustrates the nature of the helps and governments<a name="FNanchor_610_610" id="FNanchor_610_610"></a><a href="#Footnote_610_610" class="fnanchor">[610]</a> set in
the Church, to assist in the work under the direction of the
regular officers of the priesthood.</p>

<p><b>3.</b> The ministers so appointed, and the members among
whom they labor, constitute the Church of Christ, which
has been impressively compared to a perfect body, the individuals
typifying the separate members, each with its special
function, all co-operating for the welfare of the whole.<a name="FNanchor_611_611" id="FNanchor_611_611"></a><a href="#Footnote_611_611" class="fnanchor">[611]</a>
Every office so established, every officer so commissioned, is
necessary to the development of the Church and to the accomplishment
of the work of God. An organization established
of God comprises no superfluities; the eye, the ear,
the hand, the foot, every organ of the body, is essential to
the symmetry and perfection of the physical structure; in
the Church no officer can rightly say to another, "I have
no need of thee."<a name="FNanchor_612_612" id="FNanchor_612_612"></a><a href="#Footnote_612_612" class="fnanchor">[612]</a></p>

<p><b>4.</b> The existence of these officers, and particularly their
operation with accompaniments of Divine assistance and
power, may be taken as a distinguishing characteristic of
the Church in any age of the world,&mdash;a crucial test, whereby
the validity or falsity of any claim to Divine authority may
be determined. The gospel of Christ is the everlasting
gospel; its principles, laws, and ordinances, and the Church
organization founded thereon, must be ever the same. In
searching for the true Church, therefore, one must look for
an organization comprising the offices established of old,
the callings of apostles, prophets, evangelists, high priests,
seventies, pastors, bishops, elders, priests, teachers, deacons;
not men bearing these names merely, but ministers able to
vindicate their claim to position as officers in the Lord's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
service, through the evidences of power and authority accompanying
their ministry.</p>

<p><b>5. Apostasy from the Primitive Church.</b>&mdash;The question may
fairly arise in the mind of the earnest investigator, have
these authorities and powers, together with their associated
gifts of the Spirit, remained with men from the apostolic
age to the present; in short, has there been a Church of
Christ upon the earth during this long interval? In answer,
let these facts be considered: Since the period immediately
following the ministrations of the apostles of old, and until
the present century, no organization has maintained a claim
to direct revelation from God; in fact, the teachings of the
professed ministers of the gospel for centuries have been to
the effect that such gifts of God have ceased, that the days
of miracles have gone, and that the present depends for its
guiding code wholly upon the past. A self-suggesting interpretation
of history indicates that there has been a great
departure from the way of salvation as laid down by the
Savior, a universal apostasy from the Church of Christ.<a name="FNanchor_613_613" id="FNanchor_613_613"></a><a href="#Footnote_613_613" class="fnanchor">[613]</a>
Scarcely had the Church been organized by the Savior,
whose name it bears, before the powers of darkness arrayed
themselves for conflict with the organized body. Even in
the days of Christ, persecution was bitterly waged against
the disciples; commencing with the Jews, and directed first
against the Master Himself and His few immediate associates,
this tide of opposition soon enveloped every known
follower of the Savior; so that the very name Christian
became an epithet of derision.</p>

<p><b>6.</b> In the first quarter of the fourth century, however, a
change in the attitude of paganism toward Christianity was
marked by the conversion of Constantine the Great, under
whose patronage the Christian profession grew in favor, and
became in fact the religion of the state. But what a profession,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
what a religion was it by this time! Its simplicity
had departed; earnest devotion and self-sacrificing sincerity
were no longer characteristic of the Church's ministers;
these professed followers of the humble Prophet of Nazareth,
these self-styled associates of the meek and lowly Jesus,
these loudly-proclaimed lovers of the Man of Sorrow, lived
amid conditions strangely inconsistent with the life of their
great Exemplar. Church offices were sought after for the
distinction of honor and wealth accompanying them; ministers
of the gospel affected the state of worldly authority;
bishops sought the pomp of princes, archbishops lived as
kings, and popes like emperors. With these unauthorized
and unscriptural innovations came many changes in the
ordinances of the so-called church: the rites of baptism
were perverted; the sacrament was altered; public worship
became an exhibition of art; men were canonized; martyrs
were made subjects of adoration; blasphemy grew apace, in
that men without authority essayed to exercise the prerogatives
of God in calling others to what still bore the name
of spiritual office. Ages of darkness came upon the earth;
the power of Satan seemed almost supreme.</p>

<p><b>7.</b> For a special consideration of the evidence of a general
apostasy from the Church of Christ, the student must
consult authorities on ecclesiastical history. While the fact
of the apostasy is admitted by but few such writers, the
historical events which they chronicle suggest the awful
truth. We may trace, from the days of the apostles down
to near the close of the tenth century, a constantly changing
form of Church organization, which, at the later time
named, bore but little semblance to the Church established
by the Savior. This falling away is admitted by some historians,
and as we shall presently see, it was definitely foretold
by authoritative prophecy.</p>

<p><b>8.</b> John Wesley, founder of a powerful sect, declared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
that the distinctive gifts of the Holy Ghost were no longer
with the church, having been taken away on account of
the unworthiness of professing Christians, whom he characterized
indeed as heathen, with only a dead form of worship.<a name="FNanchor_614_614" id="FNanchor_614_614"></a><a href="#Footnote_614_614" class="fnanchor">[614]</a>
In the Church of England "Homily Against Peril
of Idolatry" we read "So that laity and clergy, learned
and unlearned, all ages, sects, and degrees of men, women,
and children of whole Christendom&mdash;an horrible and most
dreadful thing to think&mdash;have been at once drowned in
abominable idolatry; of all other vices most detested of
God, and most damnable to man; and that by the space of
eight hundred years and more." Milner, an author on
church history, admits a pitiable condition of the Church
in the tenth century, and finds in that sad state a fulfillment
of scriptural predictions.</p>

<p><b>9. This Great Apostasy was Foretold.</b>&mdash;The infinite fore-knowledge
of God made plain to Him even from the beginning
this falling away from the truth; and, through
inspiration, the prophets of old uttered solemn warnings of
the approaching dangers. Surely Isaiah was gazing upon
the era of spiritual darkness when he declared, "The earth
also is defiled under the inhabitants thereof; because they
have transgressed the laws, changed the ordinance, broken
the everlasting covenant."<a name="FNanchor_615_615" id="FNanchor_615_615"></a><a href="#Footnote_615_615" class="fnanchor">[615]</a> And how deeply impressive is
the declaration of Jeremiah, "For my people have committed
two evils: they have forsaken me, the fountain of
living waters, and hewed them out cisterns, broken cisterns
that can hold no water."<a name="FNanchor_616_616" id="FNanchor_616_616"></a><a href="#Footnote_616_616" class="fnanchor">[616]</a></p>

<p><b>10.</b> The prophecies of the apostles relative to the false
teachers so soon to trouble the flock, already quoted,<a name="FNanchor_617_617" id="FNanchor_617_617"></a><a href="#Footnote_617_617" class="fnanchor">[617]</a> declare
the apostasy then rapidly approaching. Paul warned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
the Saints of Thessalonica that they be not deceived by those
who cried that the second coming of Christ was then at
hand, "For," said the apostle, "that day shall not come
except there come a falling away first, and that man of
sin be revealed, the son of perdition; Who opposeth and
exalteth himself above all that is called God, or that is
worshiped; so that he as God sitteth in the temple of
God, showing himself that he is God."<a name="FNanchor_618_618" id="FNanchor_618_618"></a><a href="#Footnote_618_618" class="fnanchor">[618]</a> This falling
away had begun even in the days of the apostles:&mdash;"Even
now," says John, "are there many anti-Christs."<a name="FNanchor_619_619" id="FNanchor_619_619"></a><a href="#Footnote_619_619" class="fnanchor">[619]</a>
And Paul, in addressing the Galatians, declared, "There be
some that trouble you, and would pervert the gospel of
Christ."<a name="FNanchor_620_620" id="FNanchor_620_620"></a><a href="#Footnote_620_620" class="fnanchor">[620]</a></p>

<p><b>11.</b> Not less conclusive are the prophecies contained in
the Book of Mormon relating to this great falling away.
Nephi, son of Lehi, predicted the oppression of the North
American Indians at the hands of the Gentiles, and declared
that at that time the people will be lifted up in self-pride,
having departed from the ordinances of God's house;
true, they will build to themselves many churches, but in
these they will preach their own wisdom, with envyings, and
strife, and malice, denying however the power and miracles
of God.<a name="FNanchor_621_621" id="FNanchor_621_621"></a><a href="#Footnote_621_621" class="fnanchor">[621]</a></p>

<p><b>12. Restoration of the Church.</b>&mdash;From the facts already
stated, it is evident that the Church was literally driven from
the earth; in the first ten centuries immediately following
the ministry of Christ, the authority of the priesthood was
lost from among men, and no human power could restore it.
But the Lord in His mercy provided for the re-establishment
of His Church in the last days, and for the last time; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
prophets of olden time fore-saw this era of renewed enlightenment,
and sang in joyous tones of its coming.<a name="FNanchor_622_622" id="FNanchor_622_622"></a><a href="#Footnote_622_622" class="fnanchor">[622]</a> It has
been already shown that this restoration was effected by the
Lord through the Prophet Joseph Smith, who, together
with Oliver Cowdery, in 1829 received the Aaronic Priesthood
under the hands of John the Baptist; and later the
Melchizedek Priesthood under the hands of the former-day
apostles, Peter, James, and John. By the authority thus
bestowed, the Church has been again organized with all its
former completeness, and mankind once more rejoices in the
priceless privileges of the counsels of God. The Latter-day
Saints declare their high claim to the true Church organization,
similar in all essentials to the organization effected by
Christ among the Jews; this people of the last days profess
to have the Priesthood of the Almighty, the power to act in
the name of God, which power commands respect both on
earth and in heaven. Let us consider the organization of
the priesthood as it exists to-day.</p>


<p class="center">PLAN OF GOVERNMENT IN THE RESTORED CHURCH.</p>

<p><b>13. Orders and Offices in the Priesthood.</b>&mdash;The Church of
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints recognizes two orders
of priesthood, the lesser called the Aaronic, the greater
known as the Melchizedek order. <em>The Aaronic Priesthood</em>
is named after Aaron, who was given to Moses as his mouth-piece,
to act under his direction in the carrying out of
God's purposes respecting Israel.<a name="FNanchor_623_623" id="FNanchor_623_623"></a><a href="#Footnote_623_623" class="fnanchor">[623]</a> For this reason, it is
sometimes called the Lesser Priesthood; but though lesser,
it is neither small nor insignificant. While Israel journeyed
in the wilderness, Aaron and his sons were called by prophecy
and set apart for the duties of the priest's office.<a name="FNanchor_624_624" id="FNanchor_624_624"></a><a href="#Footnote_624_624" class="fnanchor">[624]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span></p>

<p><b>14.</b> At a subsequent period of Israel's history, the Lord
chose the tribe of Levi to assist Aaron in the priestly functions,
the special duties of the Levites being to keep the
instruments and attend to the service of the tabernacle.
The Levites thus chosen of the Lord were to take the place
of the first-born throughout the tribes, whom the Lord had
claimed for His service from the time of the last dread
plague in Egypt, whereby the first-born in every Egyptian
house was slain, while the eldest in every Israelitish house
was hallowed and spared.<a name="FNanchor_625_625" id="FNanchor_625_625"></a><a href="#Footnote_625_625" class="fnanchor">[625]</a> The commission thus given to
the Levites is sometimes called the <em>Levitical Priesthood</em>;<a name="FNanchor_626_626" id="FNanchor_626_626"></a><a href="#Footnote_626_626" class="fnanchor">[626]</a>
it is to be regarded as an appendage to the priesthood of
Aaron, not comprising the highest priestly powers. The
Aaronic Priesthood, as restored to the earth in this dispensation,
comprises the Levitical order.<a name="FNanchor_627_627" id="FNanchor_627_627"></a><a href="#Footnote_627_627" class="fnanchor">[627]</a> This priesthood
holds the keys of the ministering of angels, and the authority
to attend to the outward ordinances, the letter of the
gospel;<a name="FNanchor_628_628" id="FNanchor_628_628"></a><a href="#Footnote_628_628" class="fnanchor">[628]</a> it comprises the offices of deacon, teacher, and
priest, with the bishopric holding the keys of presidency.</p>

<p><b>15.</b> The greater or <em>Melchizedek Priesthood</em> is named
after the king of Salem, a great High Priest of God;<a name="FNanchor_629_629" id="FNanchor_629_629"></a><a href="#Footnote_629_629" class="fnanchor">[629]</a> before
his day it was known as "the Holy Priesthood, after the
order of the Son of God, but out of respect or reverence to
the name of the Supreme Being, to avoid the too frequent
repetition of His name, they, the Church, in ancient days,
called that Priesthood after Melchizedek."<a name="FNanchor_630_630" id="FNanchor_630_630"></a><a href="#Footnote_630_630" class="fnanchor">[630]</a> This priesthood
holds the right of presidency in all the offices of the
Church; its special functions lie in the administration of
spiritual things: comprising as it does the keys of all spiritual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
blessings of the Church, the right "to have the heavens
opened unto them, to commune with the general assembly
and Church of the First Born, and to enjoy the communion
and presence of God the Father, and Jesus the Mediator of
the new covenant."<a name="FNanchor_631_631" id="FNanchor_631_631"></a><a href="#Footnote_631_631" class="fnanchor">[631]</a> The special offices of the Melchizedek
Priesthood are those of apostle, patriarch or evangelist, high
priest, seventy, and elder. Revelation from God has
defined the duties associated with each of these callings;
and the same high authority has directed the establishment
of presiding officers growing out of, or appointed from
among those who are ordained to the several offices in these
two priesthoods.<a name="FNanchor_632_632" id="FNanchor_632_632"></a><a href="#Footnote_632_632" class="fnanchor">[632]</a></p>

<p><b>16. Specific Duties in the Priesthood.&mdash;The Office of Deacon</b>
is the first or lowest in the Aaronic Priesthood. The duties
of this calling are generally of a temporal nature, pertaining
to the care of the houses of worship and the comfort
of the worshipers. In all things, however, the Deacon may
be called to assist the Teacher in his labors.<a name="FNanchor_633_633" id="FNanchor_633_633"></a><a href="#Footnote_633_633" class="fnanchor">[633]</a> Twelve deacons
form a quorum;<a name="FNanchor_634_634" id="FNanchor_634_634"></a><a href="#Footnote_634_634" class="fnanchor">[634]</a> such a body is to be presided over by
a president and counselors, selected from among their number.</p>

<p><b>17. Teachers</b> are local officers, whose function it is to
mingle with the Saints, exhorting them to their duties, and
strengthening the Church by their constant ministry; they
are to see that there is no iniquity in the Church; that the
members do not cherish ill-feelings toward one another; but
that all observe the law of God respecting Church duties.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
They may take the lead of meetings when no Priest or
higher officer is present. Both Teachers and Deacons may
preach the word of God when properly directed so to do;
but they have not the power to independently officiate in
any spiritual ordinances, such as baptizing, administering
the sacrament, or laying on of hands.<a name="FNanchor_635_635" id="FNanchor_635_635"></a><a href="#Footnote_635_635" class="fnanchor">[635]</a> Twenty-four Teachers
constitute a quorum; from among such a body a president
and counselors are to be chosen.</p>

<p><b>18. The Priests</b> are appointed to preach, teach, expound
the scripture, to baptize, to administer the sacrament, to
visit the houses of the members, exhorting them to diligence.
When properly directed, the Priest may ordain Deacons,
Teachers, and other Priests; and he may be called upon to
assist the Elder in his work. A quorum of Priests comprises
forty-eight members; such an organization is to be presided
over by a Bishop.</p>

<p><b>19. Elders</b> are empowered to officiate in any or all duties
connected with lower callings in the priesthood; and in addition,
they may ordain other Elders; confirm as members of
the Church candidates who have been properly baptized, and
confer upon them the Holy Ghost. These officers have authority
to bless children in the Church, and to take charge
of all meetings, conducting the same as they are led by the
Holy Ghost.<a name="FNanchor_636_636" id="FNanchor_636_636"></a><a href="#Footnote_636_636" class="fnanchor">[636]</a> The Elder may officiate in the stead of the
High Priest when the latter is not present. Ninety-six
Elders form a quorum; three of these constitute the presidency
of the quorum.<a name="FNanchor_637_637" id="FNanchor_637_637"></a><a href="#Footnote_637_637" class="fnanchor">[637]</a></p>

<p><b>20. Seventies</b> are traveling ministers, ordained to promulgate
the Gospel among the nations of the earth, "unto
the Gentiles first, and also unto the Jews." They are to act
under the direction of the Apostles in this exalted labor.<a name="FNanchor_638_638" id="FNanchor_638_638"></a><a href="#Footnote_638_638" class="fnanchor">[638]</a> A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
full quorum comprises seventy members, including seven
presidents.</p>

<p><b>21. High Priests</b> are ordained with power to officiate
when properly directed in all the ordinances and blessings
of the Church. They may travel as do the Seventies, carrying
the Gospel to the nations; but they are not specially
charged with this duty, their specific calling being that of
standing presidency. The High Priests of any stake of the
Church may be organized into a quorum, and this without
limit as to number; over such a quorum, three of the members
may be chosen to preside, as president and counselors.<a name="FNanchor_639_639" id="FNanchor_639_639"></a><a href="#Footnote_639_639" class="fnanchor">[639]</a></p>

<p><b>22. Patriarchs</b>, or <b>Evangelists</b>, are charged with the special
duty of blessing the Church; of course they have authority to
officiate also in other ordinances. There is one "Patriarch
to the Church," with general jurisdiction throughout the
whole organization; he holds the keys of the patriarchal
office, and unto him the promise is given "that whoever
he blesses shall be blessed, and whoever he curses shall be
cursed, that whatsoever he shall bind on earth shall be
bound in heaven, and whatsoever he shall loose on earth
shall be loosed in heaven."<a name="FNanchor_640_640" id="FNanchor_640_640"></a><a href="#Footnote_640_640" class="fnanchor">[640]</a></p>

<p><b>23.</b> Concerning the patriarchal authority, the Lord has
said: "The order of this priesthood was confirmed to be
handed down from father to son, and rightly belongs to the
literal descendants of the chosen seed to whom the promises
were made. This order was instituted in the days of Adam,
and came down by lineage."<a name="FNanchor_641_641" id="FNanchor_641_641"></a><a href="#Footnote_641_641" class="fnanchor">[641]</a> But, beside this office of
general patriarchal power, there are a number of local
Patriarchs appointed in the branches of the Church, all
subject to counsel and direction at the hands of the
"Patriarch to the Church;" yet possessing the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
privileges in their district as belong to him throughout the
Church. It is made a duty of the Twelve Apostles to
ordain evangelical ministers, or Patriarchs, in all large
branches of the Church, the selection to be made through
the power of revelation.<a name="FNanchor_642_642" id="FNanchor_642_642"></a><a href="#Footnote_642_642" class="fnanchor">[642]</a></p>

<p><b>24. Apostles</b> are called to be special witnesses of the
name of Christ in all the world;<a name="FNanchor_643_643" id="FNanchor_643_643"></a><a href="#Footnote_643_643" class="fnanchor">[643]</a> they are empowered to
build up and organize the branches of the Church; and
may officiate in any or all of the sacred ordinances. They
are to travel among the Saints, regulating the affairs of the
Church wherever they go, but particularly where there is
no complete local organization. They are authorized to
ordain Patriarchs and other officers in the priesthood, as
they may be directed by the Spirit of God.<a name="FNanchor_644_644" id="FNanchor_644_644"></a><a href="#Footnote_644_644" class="fnanchor">[644]</a></p>

<p><b>25. Presidency and Quorum Organizations.</b>&mdash;The revealed
word of God has provided for the establishment of presiding
officers "growing out of, or appointed from among those
who are ordained to the several offices in these two priesthoods."<a name="FNanchor_645_645" id="FNanchor_645_645"></a><a href="#Footnote_645_645" class="fnanchor">[645]</a>
In accordance with the prevailing principles of
order so characteristic of all His work, the Lord has directed
that the bearers of His priesthood shall be organized into
quorums, the better to aid them in learning the duties of
their stations. Some of these quorums are general in
extent and authority; others are local in their jurisdiction.
All quorums in authority and all presiding officers are to be
sustained in their several positions by the vote of the people
over whom they are appointed to preside. Local officers are
thus voted upon by the local organizations, general authorities
by the Church in conference assembled. Conferences
of the Church are held at semi-annual intervals, on which
occasions the names of all the general officers are submitted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
for the vote of the people. In like manner the authorities of
stakes and wards are sustained by vote at local conferences
held for these and other purposes. The principle of common
consent is thus observed in all the organizations of the Church.</p>

<p><b>26. The First Presidency</b> constitutes the presiding
quorum of the Church. By Divine direction, a president is
appointed from among the members of the High Priesthood
to preside over the entire Church. He is known as President
of the High Priesthood of the Church, or Presiding
High Priest over the High Priesthood of the Church.<a name="FNanchor_646_646" id="FNanchor_646_646"></a><a href="#Footnote_646_646" class="fnanchor">[646]</a> He
is called "to be a seer, a revelator, a translator, and a prophet,
having all the gifts of God which He bestows upon
the head of the Church."<a name="FNanchor_647_647" id="FNanchor_647_647"></a><a href="#Footnote_647_647" class="fnanchor">[647]</a> His station is compared by the
Lord to that of Moses of old, who stood as the mouth-piece
of God unto Israel. In his exalted labors among the
Church, this Presiding High Priest is assisted by two others
holding the same priesthood, and these three High Priests,
when properly appointed and ordained, and upheld by the
confidence, faith, and prayers of the Church, "form a quorum
of the Presidency of the Church."<a name="FNanchor_648_648" id="FNanchor_648_648"></a><a href="#Footnote_648_648" class="fnanchor">[648]</a></p>

<p><b>27. The Quorum of the Twelve Apostles.</b>&mdash;Twelve men
holding the apostleship, properly organized, constitute the
quorum of the Apostles. These the Lord has designated as
the twelve traveling counselors;<a name="FNanchor_649_649" id="FNanchor_649_649"></a><a href="#Footnote_649_649" class="fnanchor">[649]</a> they form the traveling
presiding High Council, to officiate under the direction of
the First Presidency in all parts of the world. They constitute
a quorum, whose unanimous decisions are equally
binding in power and authority with those of the First
Presidency of the Church.<a name="FNanchor_650_650" id="FNanchor_650_650"></a><a href="#Footnote_650_650" class="fnanchor">[650]</a> When the quorum of the First
Presidency is disorganized through the death or disability<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
of the President, the directing authority in government
reverts at once to the quorum of the Twelve Apostles, by
whom the nomination to the Presidency is made. There
may be apostles in the Church who are not members of
this quorum of Twelve; but such have no place in the
sittings of the quorum.</p>

<p><b>28. The Presiding Quorum of Seventy.</b>&mdash;The first quorum
of Seventies form a body whose unanimous decisions are
equally binding with those of the Twelve Apostles. Many
quorums of Seventies may be required in the work of the
Church; already there have been effected approximately
two hundred of such organizations; each quorum is presided
over by seven presidents. The seven presidents of the
First Quorum of Seventies, however, preside over all the
other quorums and their presidents.<a name="FNanchor_651_651" id="FNanchor_651_651"></a><a href="#Footnote_651_651" class="fnanchor">[651]</a></p>

<p><b>29. The Presiding Bishopric</b>, as at present constituted,
comprises the Presiding Bishop of the Church, and two
Counselors. This quorum holds jurisdiction over the duties
of other Bishops in the Church, and of all organizations
pertaining to the Aaronic Priesthood. The oldest living
representative among the sons of Aaron is entitled to this
office of presidency, provided he be in all respects worthy and
qualified; he must be designated and ordained by the First
Presidency of the Church.<a name="FNanchor_652_652" id="FNanchor_652_652"></a><a href="#Footnote_652_652" class="fnanchor">[652]</a> If such a literal descendant of
Aaron be found and ordained, he may act without counselors,
except when he sits in judgment in a trial of one of
the presidents of the High Priesthood, in which case he is
to be assisted by twelve High Priests.<a name="FNanchor_653_653" id="FNanchor_653_653"></a><a href="#Footnote_653_653" class="fnanchor">[653]</a> But in the absence
of any direct descendant of Aaron properly qualified, a High
Priest of the Melchizedek Priesthood may be called and set
apart by the First Presidency of the Church to the office of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
Presiding Bishop; he is to be assisted by two other High
Priests properly ordained as his counselors.<a name="FNanchor_654_654" id="FNanchor_654_654"></a><a href="#Footnote_654_654" class="fnanchor">[654]</a></p>

<p><b>30. Local Organizations of the Priesthood.</b>&mdash;Where the
Saints are permanently located Stakes of Zion are organized,
each Stake comprising a number of wards or branches.
Over each Stake is placed a <em>Stake Presidency</em>, consisting of a
president and two counselors, who are High Priests properly
chosen and set apart to this office. The Stake Presidency
is assisted in judicial function by a <em>Standing High Council</em>,
composed of twelve High Priests chosen and ordained to the
office. This Council is presided over by the Stake Presidency,
and forms the highest judicial tribunal of the Stake.</p>

<p><b>31.</b> The presidents of stakes and bishops of wards are
properly regarded as pastors to the fold; their duties are
doubtless analogous to those of the pastors of former dispensations.
The High Priests and the Elders in each Stake are
organized into quorums as already described; the former
without limitation as to number, the latter forming one or
more quorums, each of ninety-six members, as their number
may warrant. <em>Patriarchs</em> are also set apart to officiate in
their holy office among the people of the Stake.</p>

<p><b>32. A Ward Bishopric</b> is established in every fully organized
Ward of the Church. This body consists usually
of three High Priests set apart as a Bishop and Counselors.
If, however, a literal descendant of Aaron be called to the
bishopric, it is his privilege to act without counselors, as
was stated in the case of the Presiding Bishop. The Bishop
has jurisdiction over the quorums of the Lesser Priesthood in
his Ward, and also over holders of the Higher Priesthood as
members of his Ward; but he has no direct presidency over
quorums of the Melchizedek order, as such, which may be
embraced within his domain. As a presiding High Priest,
he properly presides over his entire Ward. The ward organization<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
comprises quorums of Priests, Teachers, and
Deacons, one or more of each as the numerical extent of
the Ward may determine.</p>

<p><b>33. Helps in Government.</b>&mdash;Beside these constituted
authorities and offices in the priesthood, there are a number
of secondary or special organizations established among the
people for educational and benevolent purposes. Among
these, the following are of such importance as to call for
special mention.</p>

<p>(1.) <em>Primary Associations.</em>&mdash;These provide for the
moral instruction and training of young children.</p>

<p>(2.) <em>Mutual Improvement Associations.</em>&mdash;These comprise
separate organizations for the sexes, and are designed for
the education and training of the youth, in subjects of general
and theological interest. Instruction is provided in
theology, literature and history, science and art, the laws of
health, and numerous other branches of useful knowledge.</p>

<p>(3.) <em>Sunday Schools</em> comprise graded classes for the
study of the scriptures, and for training in theology, in
moral and religious duties, and in the discipline of the
Church. Sunday schools, while primarily designed for the
young, are open to all.</p>

<p>(4.) <em>Church Schools.</em>&mdash;These institutions provide for both
secular and religious instruction, and range from the grade
of the kindergarten to that of the college.</p>

<p>(5.) <em>Religion Classes.</em>&mdash;In these is provided a course of
graded instruction in theology and religion, which is offered
as a supplement and complement to the purely secular teachings
of the non-denominational schools.</p>

<p>(6.) <em>Relief Societies.</em>&mdash;These are composed of women
whose self-imposed duties relate to the care of the poor, and
the relief of suffering among the afflicted.</p>

<p><b>34.</b> Most of these auxiliary organizations exist in each
ward. Indeed, with the exception of Church Schools, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
usually rank as stake institutions, or even as of wider
scope, all of the secondary organizations named are regarded
as essential to the complete equipment of any ward.
Officers are appointed to preside over the several organizations
in each ward; and while such officers are subject in
a general way to the local authorities in the priesthood,
they look for specific instructions regarding the plan and
method of their particular work, to the stake and general
authorities of the special organizations. In accordance with
the principle of common consent which characterizes the
Church in general, the officers of the auxiliary institutions,
while they are nominated by, or at least with the consent of
the established authorities in the priesthood, are installed
and retained in office by the vote of the members in the
local or general organization within which they are appointed
to labor.</p>


<h3>NOTES.</h3>

<blockquote>

<p><b>1. Degeneracy of Worship Incident to the Apostasy.</b>&mdash;That, as the
priesthood disappeared from the earth after the apostolic period, the forms of worship
were perverted, while many pagan influences and practices crept in, may be reasonably
inferred from the records of history. Mosheim, an authority of note in ecclesiastical
history, has this to say regarding pagan innovations during the fourth century:&mdash;"The
Christian bishops introduced, with but slight alterations, into the Christian worship,
those rites and institutions by which, formerly, the Greeks and Romans and other
nations had manifested their piety and reverence towards their imaginary deities; supposing
that the people would more readily embrace Christianity, if they saw that the
rites handed down to them from their fathers still existed unchanged among the Christians,
and perceived that Christ and the martyrs were worshiped in the same manner as
formerly their gods were. There was, of course, little difference, in these times, between
the public worship of the Christians and that of the Greeks and Romans. In both
alike, there were splendid robes, mitres, tiaras, wax tapers, crosiers, processions, illustrations,
images, golden and silver vases, and numberless other things."</p>

<p>Of the form of professedly Christian worship in the fifth century, the same authority
says:&mdash;"Public worship everywhere assumed a form more calculated for show and for
the gratification of the eye. Various ornaments were added to the sacerdotal garments,
in order to increase the veneration of the people for the clerical order.... In some
places it was appointed that the praises of God should be sung perpetually night and
day, the singers succeeding each other without interruption: as if the Supreme Being
took pleasure in clamor and noise, and in the flatteries of men. The magnificence of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
the temples knew no bounds. Splendid images were placed in them; ... the
image of the Virgin Mary holding her infant in her arms occupied the most conspicuous
place."</p>

<p><b>2. Early Beginning of the Apostasy.</b>&mdash;Orson Pratt, an apostle of the present
age, has written as follows concerning the early falling away from the authorized
practices of the Church:&mdash;"The great apostasy of the Christian church commenced in
the first century, while there were yet inspired apostles and prophets in their midst;
hence Paul, just previous to his martyrdom, enumerates a great number who had 'made
shipwreck of their faith,' and 'turned aside into vain jangling,' teaching 'that the resurrection
was already past;' giving 'heed to fables and endless genealogies;' 'doubting
about questions and strifes of words whereof come envyings, railings, evil surmisings,
perverse disputings of men of corrupt minds, and destitute of the truth, supposing that
gain is godliness.' This apostasy had become so general that Paul declares to Timothy
'that all they which are in Asia be turned away from me;' and again he says, 'at my
first answer, no man stood with me, but all men forsook me;' he further states that
'there are many unruly, and vain talkers, deceivers,' 'teaching things which they ought
not, for filthy lucre's sake.' These apostates, no doubt, pretended to be very righteous,
'for,' says the apostle, 'they profess that they know God, but in works they deny him,
being abominable and disobedient, and unto every good work reprobate.'"</p>

<p><b>3. The Rule of the Priesthood.</b>&mdash;That the power of the Priesthood is to be
exercised in the spirit of patience and love, and not in opposition to individual free
agency, is apparent from many scriptures, among which is the following:&mdash;"Behold,
there are many called, but few are chosen. And why are they not chosen? Because
their hearts are set so much upon the things of this world, and aspire to the honors of
men, that they do not learn this one lesson&mdash;That the rights of the Priesthood are inseparably
connected with the powers of heaven, and that the powers of heaven cannot be
controlled nor handled only upon the principles of righteousness. That they may be
conferred upon us, it is true; but when we undertake to cover our sins, or to gratify our
pride, or vain ambition, or to exercise control, or dominion, or compulsion, upon the
souls of the children of men, in any degree of unrighteousness, behold, the heavens
withdraw themselves; the Spirit of the Lord is grieved; and when it is withdrawn,
Amen to the Priesthood, or the authority of that man. Behold, ere he is aware, he is
left unto himself, to kick against the pricks; to persecute the saints; and to fight against
God. We have learned, by sad experience, that it is the nature and disposition of almost
all men: as soon as they get a little authority, as they suppose, they will immediately
begin to exercise unrighteous dominion. Hence, many are called, but few are chosen.
No power or influence can or ought to be maintained by virtue of the Priesthood, only by
persuasion, by long-suffering, by gentleness, and meekness, and by love unfeigned; by
kindness, and pure knowledge, which shall greatly enlarge the soul without hypocrisy
and without guile; Reproving betimes with sharpness, when moved upon by the Holy
Ghost, and then showing forth afterwards an increase of love toward him whom thou
hast reproved, lest he esteem thee to be his enemy; That he may know that thy faithfulness
is stronger than the cords of death. Let thy bowels also be full of charity towards
all men, and to the household of faith; and let virtue garnish thy thoughts unceasingly;
then shall thy confidence wax strong in the presence of God, and the doctrine of the
Priesthood shall distil upon thy soul as the dews from heaven. The Holy Ghost shall be
thy constant companion, and thy sceptre an unchanging sceptre of righteousness and
truth; and thy dominion shall be an everlasting dominion, and without compulsory
means it shall flow unto thee forever and ever."&mdash;Doc. and Cov. cxxi, 34-46.</p></blockquote>

<h3>SPIRITUAL GIFTS.</h3>

<p><b>1. Spiritual Gifts Characteristic of the Church.</b>&mdash;It has
been already affirmed, that all men who would officiate
with propriety in the ordinances of the Gospel must be
commissioned for their exalted duties by the power and
authority of heaven. When so divinely invested, these
servants of the Lord will not be lacking in proofs of the
Master's favor; for it has ever been characteristic of the
dealings of God with His people, to manifest His power by
the bestowal of a variety of ennobling graces, which are
properly called gifts of the Spirit. These are oft-times
exhibited in a manner so different from the usual order of
things as to be called miraculous and supernatural. In this
way did the Lord make Himself known in the early times of
scriptural history; and from the days of Adam until the
present, prophets of God have generally been endowed with
such power. Whenever the priesthood has operated through
an organized Church on the earth, the members of the flock
have been strengthened in their faith, and otherwise blessed
in numerous related ways, by the possession of these graces
within the Church. We may safely regard the existence of
these spiritual powers as one of the essential characteristics
of the true Church; where they are not, the priesthood of
God does not operate.</p>

<p><b>2.</b> Mormon<a name="FNanchor_655_655" id="FNanchor_655_655"></a><a href="#Footnote_655_655" class="fnanchor">[655]</a> solemnly declares that the days of miracles
will not pass from the Church, as long as there shall be a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
man upon the earth to be saved; "For," says he, "it is by
faith that miracles are wrought; and it is by faith that
angels appear and minister unto men; wherefore if these
things have ceased, wo be unto the children of men, for it
is because of unbelief, and all is vain." And Moroni,
standing on the threshold of the grave, bears an independent
testimony that the gifts and graces of the Spirit will
never be done away as long as the world shall stand, except
it be through the unbelief of mankind.<a name="FNanchor_656_656" id="FNanchor_656_656"></a><a href="#Footnote_656_656" class="fnanchor">[656]</a></p>

<p><b>3.</b> Hear the words of this prophet addressed to those
"who deny the revelations of God and say that they are
done away, that there are no revelations nor prophecies, nor
gifts, nor healing, nor speaking with tongues, and the interpretation
of tongues. Behold I say unto you, he that
denieth these things knoweth not the Gospel of Christ; yea
he has not read the scriptures; if so, he does not understand
them. For do we not read that God is the same yesterday,
to-day, and forever, and in him there is no variableness
neither shadow of changing? And now, if ye have imagined
up unto yourselves a god who doth vary, and in him there is
shadow of changing, then have ye imagined up unto yourselves
a god who is not a God of miracles. But behold, I
will show unto you a God of miracles, even the God of
Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob; and
it is that same God who created the heavens and the earth,
and all things that in them are."<a name="FNanchor_657_657" id="FNanchor_657_657"></a><a href="#Footnote_657_657" class="fnanchor">[657]</a></p>

<p><b>4. Nature of Spiritual Gifts.</b>&mdash;The gifts here spoken of
are essentially endowments of power and authority, through
which the purposes of God are accomplished, sometimes
with accompanying conditions that appear to be supernatural.
By such the sick may be healed, malignant influences
overcome, spirits of darkness subdued, the Saints, humble<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
and weak, may proclaim their testimonies and otherwise
utter praises unto God in new and strange tongues, and
others may interpret these words; the feeble human intellect
may be invigorated by the heavenly touch of spiritual
vision and blessed dreams, to see and comprehend things
ordinarily withheld from mortal senses; direct communication
with the fountain of all wisdom may be established,
and the revelations of the Divine will may be obtained.</p>

<p><b>5.</b> These gifts have been promised of the Lord unto
those who believe in His name;<a name="FNanchor_658_658" id="FNanchor_658_658"></a><a href="#Footnote_658_658" class="fnanchor">[658]</a> they are to follow obedience
to the requirements of the Gospel. Among believers,
they are to serve for encouragement, and as incentives to
higher communion with the Spirit.<a name="FNanchor_659_659" id="FNanchor_659_659"></a><a href="#Footnote_659_659" class="fnanchor">[659]</a> They are not given as
signs to gratify carnal curiosity; nor to satisfy a morbid
craving for the wonderful. Men have been led to the light
through manifestations of the miraculous; but events in
the lives of these show that they are either such as would
have found a knowledge of the truth in some other way, or
they are but superficially affected, and as soon as the novelty
of the new sensation has exhausted itself they wander again
into the darkness from which they had for the time escaped.
Miracles are not primarily intended, surely they are not
needed, to prove the power of God; the simpler occurrences,
the more ordinary works of creation do that. But unto the
heart already softened and purified by the testimony of the
truth, to the mind enlightened through the Spirit's power
and conscious of obedient service in the requirements of the
gospel, the voice of miracles comes with cheering tidings of a
loving Parent's continued favor, with fresh and more abundant
evidences of the magnanimity of an all-merciful God.<a name="FNanchor_660_660" id="FNanchor_660_660"></a><a href="#Footnote_660_660" class="fnanchor">[660]</a></p>

<p><b>6.</b> Yet even to the unbeliever, the testimony of miracles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
should appeal, at least to the extent of argument favoring
an investigation of the power through which these acts are
wrought; in such cases miracles are as "a loud voice addressed
to those who are hard of hearing." The purpose of
spiritual gifts in the Church is explicitly set forth in a
revelation from the Lord through Joseph Smith:&mdash;"Wherefore,
beware lest ye be deceived; and that ye may not be
deceived, seek ye earnestly the best gifts, always remembering
for what they are given; For verily I say unto you,
they are given for the benefit of those who love me and keep
all my commandments, and him that seeketh so to do, that all
may be benefited that seeketh or that asketh of me, that asketh
and not for a sign that he may consume it upon his lusts."<a name="FNanchor_661_661" id="FNanchor_661_661"></a><a href="#Footnote_661_661" class="fnanchor">[661]</a></p>

<p><b>7. Miracles</b> are commonly regarded as supernatural occurrences,
taking place in opposition to the laws of nature.
Such a conception is plainly erroneous, for the laws of
nature are inviolable. However, as human understanding
of these laws is at best but imperfect, events strictly in
accordance with natural law may appear contrary thereto.
The entire constitution of nature is founded on system and
order; the laws of nature, however, are graded as are the
laws of man. The application of a higher law in any
particular case does not destroy the efficacy or validity of
an inferior one; the lower law is as fully applicable as before
to the case for which it is framed. For example, society
has enacted a law forbidding, on peril of heavy penalties,
any man appropriating the property of another; yet oftentimes
officers of the law forcibly seize the possessions of
their fellow-men, against whom judgments may have been
rendered; and such acts are done to satisfy, not to violate
justice. Jehovah commanded "Thou shalt not kill," and
mankind has re-enacted the law, prescribing penalties for
violation thereof. Yet sacred history testifies, that, in certain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
cases, the Lawgiver Himself has directly commanded
His servants to vindicate justice by taking human life.
The judge who passes the extreme sentence upon a convicted
murderer, and the executioner who carries into effect
that dread mandate, act not in opposition to "Thou shalt
not kill," but actually in support of this decree.</p>

<p><b>8.</b> With some of the principles upon which the powers of
nature operate, we are in a degree acquainted; and in contemplating
them we are no longer surprised, though deeper
reflection may show that even the commonest occurrence is
wonderful and strange. But any event beyond the ordinary
is pronounced miraculous, supernatural, if not indeed unnatural,
and we are more or less awe-stricken by the same.<a name="FNanchor_662_662" id="FNanchor_662_662"></a><a href="#Footnote_662_662" class="fnanchor">[662]</a>
When the prophet Elisha caused the axe to float in the
river,<a name="FNanchor_663_663" id="FNanchor_663_663"></a><a href="#Footnote_663_663" class="fnanchor">[663]</a> he brought to his service, through the exercise of
the authority of the priesthood, a power superior to that of
gravity. Without doubt, the iron was heavier than the
water; yet by the operation of this higher force it was supported,
suspended, or otherwise sustained at the surface, as
if it were held there by a human hand, or rendered sufficiently
buoyant by attached floaters.</p>

<p><b>9.</b> Wine ordinarily consists of about four-fifths water,
the rest being a variety of chemical compounds the elements
of which are abundantly present in the air and soil.
The ordinary method&mdash;what we term the natural method&mdash;of
bringing these elements into proper combination is by
planting the grape, then cultivating the vine till the fruit is
ready to yield its juice in the press. But by the exercise of
a power not within purely human reach, the Savior, at the
marriage in Cana,<a name="FNanchor_664_664" id="FNanchor_664_664"></a><a href="#Footnote_664_664" class="fnanchor">[664]</a> called those elements together, and
brought about a chemical transformation within the water-pots<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
of stone, resulting in the production of pure wine. So,
too, when the multitudes were fed, under His priestly touch
and authoritative blessing the bread and fishes increased in
substance, as if the seasons of years had been consumed in
their growth according to what we consider the natural
order. In healing the leprous, the palsied, and the infirm,
the disordered bodily parts were brought again into their
normal and healthful state; the impurities operating as
poisons in the tissues were removed by means more rapid
and effectual than those which depend upon the action of
drugs and medicine.</p>

<p><b>10.</b> No earnest observer, no reasoning mind, can doubt
the existence of intelligences and organisms which the
senses of man do not reveal. This world seems but the
temporal embodiment of things spiritual. The Creator has
told us that He formed all things spiritual before they were
made temporal.<a name="FNanchor_665_665" id="FNanchor_665_665"></a><a href="#Footnote_665_665" class="fnanchor">[665]</a> The flowers that flourish and die on earth
are perhaps represented above by imperishable blossoms of
transcendent beauty and entertaining fragrance. Man is
shaped after the image of Deity; his mind, though darkened
by custom and weakened by injurious habit, is still a fallen
type of immortal thought and Divine reason; and though
the space separating the human and the Divine in thought,
desire, and action, be as wide as that between sea and sky,
for as the stars are above the earth so are the ways of God
above those of man, yet we may affirm a strict analogy
between the spiritual and the temporal. When the eyes of
Elisha's servant were opened, the man saw the hosts of
heavenly warriors covering the mountains about Dothan,&mdash;footmen,
horsemen, and chariots, armed for fight against
the Syrians.<a name="FNanchor_666_666" id="FNanchor_666_666"></a><a href="#Footnote_666_666" class="fnanchor">[666]</a> When Israel encompassed Jericho,<a name="FNanchor_667_667" id="FNanchor_667_667"></a><a href="#Footnote_667_667" class="fnanchor">[667]</a> may we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
not believe that the Captain of the Lord's host<a name="FNanchor_668_668" id="FNanchor_668_668"></a><a href="#Footnote_668_668" class="fnanchor">[668]</a> and his
heavenly train were there, and that before their angelic
powers, sustained by the faith and obedience of the mortal
army, the walls were leveled?</p>

<p><b>11.</b> Some of the latest and highest achievements of man
in the utilization of natural forces approach the conditions
of spiritual operations. To count the ticking of a watch a
hundred miles away; to speak in but an ordinary tone and
be heard across the country; to signal from one hemisphere
and be understood on the other though oceans roll and
roar between; to bring the lightning into our homes and
make it serve as fire and torch;&mdash;are not these miracles?
The possibility of such would not have been received with
credence before their actual accomplishment. The President
of the Republic, sitting in his chair of state at the
nation's capital, talks with all parts, even with the ends of
this great country; and if the apparatus be in order, if
operators and officials be true, he is rightly informed of
every movement of importance anywhere in the land. The
orbs of the universe are as truly connected by a system of
inter-communication, surprisingly perfect in its action and
adaptation. These and the other innumerable miracles of
creation are accomplished in strict accordance with the laws
of nature, which are the laws of God. But we must return
to a further consideration of the specific manifestations of
spiritual gifts within the Church.</p>

<p><b>12. An Enumeration of the Gifts of the Spirit</b> cannot be
made complete by man, so numerous, so extensive are the
blessings of the Father for His children. Yet the more
common of these spiritual manifestations have been specified
by inspired scriptural writers, and by the sure word of
revelation. Paul writing to the Corinthian Saints,<a name="FNanchor_669_669" id="FNanchor_669_669"></a><a href="#Footnote_669_669" class="fnanchor">[669]</a> Moroni<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
inditing his last appeal to the Lamanites,<a name="FNanchor_670_670" id="FNanchor_670_670"></a><a href="#Footnote_670_670" class="fnanchor">[670]</a> and the voice of
the Lord directed to the people of His Church in this dispensation,<a name="FNanchor_671_671" id="FNanchor_671_671"></a><a href="#Footnote_671_671" class="fnanchor">[671]</a>
each names many of the great gifts of the Spirit.
From these scriptures, we learn that every man has received
some gift from God; and in the great diversity of gifts all
do not receive the same. "To some it is given by the Holy
Ghost to know the differences of administration....
And again it is given by the Holy Ghost to some to know
the diversities of operations whether it be of God, that the
manifestations of the Spirit may be given to every man to
profit withal. And again, verily I say unto you, to some it
is given by the Spirit of God, the word of wisdom; to
another it is given the word of knowledge, that all may be
taught to be wise, and to have knowledge. And again to
some it is given to have faith to be healed; and to others it
is given to have faith to heal. And again to some it is given
the working of miracles, and to others it is given to
prophesy, and to others the discerning of spirits. And
again, it is given to some to speak with tongues; and to
another it is given the interpretation of tongues; and all
these gifts cometh from God for the benefit of the children
of God."<a name="FNanchor_672_672" id="FNanchor_672_672"></a><a href="#Footnote_672_672" class="fnanchor">[672]</a></p>

<p><b>13. The Gift of Tongues and Interpretation.</b>&mdash;The gift
of tongues constituted one of the first miraculous manifestations
of the Holy Ghost unto the apostles of old. It was
included by the Savior among the special signs appointed to
follow the believer; "In my name," said He, "they shall
speak with new tongues."<a name="FNanchor_673_673" id="FNanchor_673_673"></a><a href="#Footnote_673_673" class="fnanchor">[673]</a> The early fulfillment of this
promise in the case of the apostles themselves was realized
on the succeeding Pentecost, when they, having assembled
in one place, were filled with the Holy Ghost and began to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
speak in strange tongues.<a name="FNanchor_674_674" id="FNanchor_674_674"></a><a href="#Footnote_674_674" class="fnanchor">[674]</a> When the door of the Gospel
was first opened to the Gentiles, the converts rejoiced in the
Holy Ghost which had fallen upon them and which gave
them utterance in tongues.<a name="FNanchor_675_675" id="FNanchor_675_675"></a><a href="#Footnote_675_675" class="fnanchor">[675]</a> This gift with others manifested
itself among certain disciples at Ephesus,<a name="FNanchor_676_676" id="FNanchor_676_676"></a><a href="#Footnote_676_676" class="fnanchor">[676]</a> on the
occasion of their receiving the Holy Ghost. In the present
dispensation, this gift, again promised to the Saints, finds
frequent exercise. Its chief employment is in the function
of praise rather than that of instruction and preaching;
and this is agreeable to Paul's teaching, "For he that
speaketh in an unknown tongue speaketh not unto men
but unto God."<a name="FNanchor_677_677" id="FNanchor_677_677"></a><a href="#Footnote_677_677" class="fnanchor">[677]</a> An unusual manifestation of the gift
was witnessed on the occasion of the Pentecostal conversion
of the Jews, already referred to, when the apostles addressing
the multitude, were understood by all the diversified
company, each listener hearing their teachings in his own
tongue.<a name="FNanchor_678_678" id="FNanchor_678_678"></a><a href="#Footnote_678_678" class="fnanchor">[678]</a> This special gift was here associated with higher
endowments of power; the occasion was one of instruction,
admonition, and prophecy. The gift of interpretation may
be possessed by the one speaking in tongues, though more
commonly the separate powers are exercised by different
persons.</p>

<p><b>14. The Gift of Healing</b> was exercised extensively in the
dispensation of the Savior and His apostles; indeed, healing
constituted by far the greater part of the miracles wrought
at that time. By authoritative ministrations, the eyes of
the blind were opened; the dumb were made to speak; the
deaf to hear; the lame leaped for joy; afflicted mortals,
bowed with infirmity, were lifted erect and enjoyed the
vigor of youth; the palsied were made well; lepers were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
cleansed; impotence was banished; and fevers were assuaged.
In this, the dispensation of the fulness of times,
this power is possessed by the Church, and its manifestation
is of frequent occurrence among the Saints. Thousands of
blessed recipients can testify to the fulfillment of the Lord's
promise, that if His servants lay hands on the sick, they
shall recover.<a name="FNanchor_679_679" id="FNanchor_679_679"></a><a href="#Footnote_679_679" class="fnanchor">[679]</a></p>

<p><b>15.</b> The usual method of administering to the sick is by
the imposition of hands of those who possess the requisite
authority of the priesthood;&mdash;this being agreeable to the
Savior's instructions in former days,<a name="FNanchor_680_680" id="FNanchor_680_680"></a><a href="#Footnote_680_680" class="fnanchor">[680]</a> and according to
Divine revelation in the present day.<a name="FNanchor_681_681" id="FNanchor_681_681"></a><a href="#Footnote_681_681" class="fnanchor">[681]</a> This part of the
ordinance is usually preceded by an anointing with oil
previously consecrated. The Latter-day Saints profess to
abide by the counsels of James of old,<a name="FNanchor_682_682" id="FNanchor_682_682"></a><a href="#Footnote_682_682" class="fnanchor">[682]</a> "Is any sick among
you? Let him call for the elders of the church, and let
them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of
the Lord; and the prayer of faith shall save the sick, and
the Lord shall raise him up; and if he have committed sins,
they shall be forgiven him."</p>

<p><b>16.</b> Though the authority to administer to the sick
belongs to the elders of the Church in general, some possess
this power in an unusual degree, having received it as a
special endowment of the Spirit. Another gift, allied to
this, is the power of exercising faith to be healed;<a name="FNanchor_683_683" id="FNanchor_683_683"></a><a href="#Footnote_683_683" class="fnanchor">[683]</a> which is
manifested in varying degrees. Not always are the administrations
of the elders followed by immediate healings; the
afflicted may be permitted to suffer in body, perhaps for the
accomplishment of Divine purposes,<a name="FNanchor_684_684" id="FNanchor_684_684"></a><a href="#Footnote_684_684" class="fnanchor">[684]</a> and in the time appointed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
of the Lord, His children pass through bodily
death. But let the counsels of God be observed in administering
to the afflicted; then if they recover, they
live unto the Lord; and the assuring promise is added
that those who die under such conditions die unto the
Lord.<a name="FNanchor_685_685" id="FNanchor_685_685"></a><a href="#Footnote_685_685" class="fnanchor">[685]</a></p>

<p><b>17. Visions and Dreams</b> have constituted a means of communication
between God and His children in every dispensation
of the priesthood. In general, visions are manifested
to the waking senses, whilst dreams are given during sleep.
In the vision, however, the senses may be so affected as to
render the person practically unconscious, at least oblivious
to ordinary occurrences, while he is able to discern the
heavenly manifestation. In the earlier dispensations, the
Lord very frequently communicated through dreams and
visions, often-times revealing to His prophets the events
of the future even to the latest generations. From the
multitude of instances recorded, let us select a few. Consider
the case of Enoch,<a name="FNanchor_686_686" id="FNanchor_686_686"></a><a href="#Footnote_686_686" class="fnanchor">[686]</a> unto whom the Lord spake face to
face, showing him the course of the human family until and
beyond the second coming of the Savior. The brother of
Jared<a name="FNanchor_687_687" id="FNanchor_687_687"></a><a href="#Footnote_687_687" class="fnanchor">[687]</a> because of his righteousness was so blessed of God
as to be shown all the inhabitants of the earth, both those
who had previously existed and those who were to follow.
Unto Moses the will of God was made known with the visual
manifestation of fire.<a name="FNanchor_688_688" id="FNanchor_688_688"></a><a href="#Footnote_688_688" class="fnanchor">[688]</a> Lehi received his instructions to
leave Jerusalem<a name="FNanchor_689_689" id="FNanchor_689_689"></a><a href="#Footnote_689_689" class="fnanchor">[689]</a> through dreams; and on many subsequent
occasions the Lord communicated with this patriarch of the
western world by visions and by dreams. The Old Testament
prophets were generally so favored; e. g., Jacob the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
father of all Israel,<a name="FNanchor_690_690" id="FNanchor_690_690"></a><a href="#Footnote_690_690" class="fnanchor">[690]</a> Job the patient sufferer,<a name="FNanchor_691_691" id="FNanchor_691_691"></a><a href="#Footnote_691_691" class="fnanchor">[691]</a> Jeremiah,<a name="FNanchor_692_692" id="FNanchor_692_692"></a><a href="#Footnote_692_692" class="fnanchor">[692]</a>
Ezekiel,<a name="FNanchor_693_693" id="FNanchor_693_693"></a><a href="#Footnote_693_693" class="fnanchor">[693]</a> Daniel,<a name="FNanchor_694_694" id="FNanchor_694_694"></a><a href="#Footnote_694_694" class="fnanchor">[694]</a> Habakkuk,<a name="FNanchor_695_695" id="FNanchor_695_695"></a><a href="#Footnote_695_695" class="fnanchor">[695]</a> Zechariah.<a name="FNanchor_696_696" id="FNanchor_696_696"></a><a href="#Footnote_696_696" class="fnanchor">[696]</a></p>

<p><b>18.</b> The dispensation of Christ and His apostles was
marked by similar manifestations. The birth of John the
Baptist was fore-told to his father while he was officiating in
priestly functions.<a name="FNanchor_697_697" id="FNanchor_697_697"></a><a href="#Footnote_697_697" class="fnanchor">[697]</a> Joseph, betrothed to the Virgin, received
through an angel's visit<a name="FNanchor_698_698" id="FNanchor_698_698"></a><a href="#Footnote_698_698" class="fnanchor">[698]</a> tidings of the Christ yet to be
born; and on subsequent occasions he received warnings and
instructions in dreams concerning the welfare of the Holy
Child.<a name="FNanchor_699_699" id="FNanchor_699_699"></a><a href="#Footnote_699_699" class="fnanchor">[699]</a> The Magi, returning from their pilgrimage of worship,
were warned in dreams of Herod's treacherous designs.<a name="FNanchor_700_700" id="FNanchor_700_700"></a><a href="#Footnote_700_700" class="fnanchor">[700]</a>
Saul of Tarsus was shown in a vision the messenger whom
God was about to send to him to minister in the ordinances
of the priesthood;<a name="FNanchor_701_701" id="FNanchor_701_701"></a><a href="#Footnote_701_701" class="fnanchor">[701]</a> and other visions followed.<a name="FNanchor_702_702" id="FNanchor_702_702"></a><a href="#Footnote_702_702" class="fnanchor">[702]</a> Peter was
prepared for the ministry to the Gentiles through a vision;<a name="FNanchor_703_703" id="FNanchor_703_703"></a><a href="#Footnote_703_703" class="fnanchor">[703]</a>
and John was so favored of God in this respect that the
book of Revelation is occupied by the record.</p>

<p><b>19.</b> Most of the visions and dreams recorded in scripture
have been given to the chosen people through the ministering
priesthood; but there are exceptional instances of such
manifestations unto some, who, at the time, had not entered
the fold. Such, for example, was the case with Saul and
Cornelius; but in these instances the Divine manifestations
were immediately preliminary to conversion. Dreams with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
special import were given to Pharaoh,<a name="FNanchor_704_704" id="FNanchor_704_704"></a><a href="#Footnote_704_704" class="fnanchor">[704]</a> Nebuchadnezzar,<a name="FNanchor_705_705" id="FNanchor_705_705"></a><a href="#Footnote_705_705" class="fnanchor">[705]</a> and
others; but it required a higher power than their own to
interpret them; and Joseph and Daniel were called to officiate.
The dream given to the Midianite soldier, and its interpretation
by his fellow,<a name="FNanchor_706_706" id="FNanchor_706_706"></a><a href="#Footnote_706_706" class="fnanchor">[706]</a> betokening the victory of Gideon,
were true manifestations; as also the dream of Pilate's wife,<a name="FNanchor_707_707" id="FNanchor_707_707"></a><a href="#Footnote_707_707" class="fnanchor">[707]</a>
in which she learned of the innocence of the accused Christ.</p>

<p><b>20. The Gift of Prophecy</b> distinguishes its possessor as a
prophet,&mdash;literally, one who speaks for another; specifically,
one who speaks for God,<a name="FNanchor_708_708" id="FNanchor_708_708"></a><a href="#Footnote_708_708" class="fnanchor">[708]</a> It is distinguished by Paul as
one of the most desirable of spiritual endowments, and its
pre-eminence over the gift of tongues he discusses at length.<a name="FNanchor_709_709" id="FNanchor_709_709"></a><a href="#Footnote_709_709" class="fnanchor">[709]</a>
To prophesy is to receive and declare the word of God, and
the statement of His will to the people. The function of
prediction, often regarded as the sole essential of prophecy,
is but one among many characteristics of this divinely given
power. The prophet may have as much concern with the
past as with the present or the future; he may exercise his
gift in teaching through the light of, and by the experience
of preceding events, as in fore-telling occurrences. The
prophets of God have ever been in special favor with Him,
being privileged to learn of His will and designs; indeed, the
promise is made that the Lord will do nothing except He
reveal His secret purposes unto His servants, the prophets.<a name="FNanchor_710_710" id="FNanchor_710_710"></a><a href="#Footnote_710_710" class="fnanchor">[710]</a>
These chosen oracles stand as mediators between God and
mortals, pleading for or against the people.<a name="FNanchor_711_711" id="FNanchor_711_711"></a><a href="#Footnote_711_711" class="fnanchor">[711]</a></p>

<p><b>21.</b> No special ordination in the priesthood is essential to
man's receiving the gift of prophecy; bearers of the Melchizedek<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
order, Adam, Noah, Moses, and a multitude of
others were truly prophets, but not more truly so than were
many who exercised the Aaronic functions only&mdash;as for
example most of the Old Testament priests subsequent to
the time of Moses, and John the Baptist.<a name="FNanchor_712_712" id="FNanchor_712_712"></a><a href="#Footnote_712_712" class="fnanchor">[712]</a> The ministrations
of the prophetesses Miriam<a name="FNanchor_713_713" id="FNanchor_713_713"></a><a href="#Footnote_713_713" class="fnanchor">[713]</a> and Deborah<a name="FNanchor_714_714" id="FNanchor_714_714"></a><a href="#Footnote_714_714" class="fnanchor">[714]</a> show that this
gift may be possessed by women also. In the time of
Samuel, the prophets were organized into a special order, to
aid their purposes of study and improvement.<a name="FNanchor_715_715" id="FNanchor_715_715"></a><a href="#Footnote_715_715" class="fnanchor">[715]</a></p>

<p><b>22.</b> In the present dispensation, this great gift is enjoyed
in a fulness equal to that of any preceding time. The
Lord's will concerning present duties is made known to His
people through the mouths of prophets; and events of great
import are fore-told.<a name="FNanchor_716_716" id="FNanchor_716_716"></a><a href="#Footnote_716_716" class="fnanchor">[716]</a> The very fact of the present existence
and growing condition of the Church is an undeniable testimony
of the power and reliability of modern prophecy. The
Latter-day Saints constitute a body of witnesses, numbering
hundreds of thousands, to the effect of this, one of the great
gifts of God.</p>

<p><b>23. Revelation</b> is the means through which the will of
God is declared directly and in fulness to man. Under
circumstances best suiting the Divine purposes, through the
dreams of sleep or in waking visions of the mind, by voices
without visional appearance, or by actual manifestations of
the Holy Presence before the eye, God makes known His
designs, and charges His chosen vessels to bear the sacred
messages so imparted. Under the influence of inspiration,
or its more potent manifestation&mdash;revelation, man's mind is
enlightened, and his energies quickened to the accomplishment
of wonders in the work of human progress; touched<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
with a spark from the heavenly altar, the inspired instrument
cherishes the holy fire within his soul, and imparts it to
others as he may be led to do; he is the channel through
which the will of God is conveyed. The words of him who
speaks by revelation in its highest form, are not his own;
they are the words of God Himself; the mortal mouth-piece
is but the trusted conveyer of these heavenly messages.
With the authoritative, "Thus saith the Lord," the
revelator delivers the burden intrusted to his care.</p>

<p><b>24.</b> The Lord strictly observes the principles of order and
propriety in giving revelation to His servants. Though it is
the privilege of any person to live so as to merit this gift in
the affairs of his special calling, only those appointed and
ordained to the offices of presidency are to be revelators to
the people at large. Concerning the President of the
Church, who at the time of the revelation here referred to
was the Prophet Joseph Smith, the Lord has said to
the elders of the Church:&mdash;"And this ye shall know
assuredly, that there is none other appointed unto you to
receive commandments and revelations until he be taken, if
he abide in me.... And this shall be a law unto
you, that ye receive not the teachings of any that shall
come before you, as revelations or commandments. And
this I give unto you that you may not be deceived, that you
may know they are not of me."<a name="FNanchor_717_717" id="FNanchor_717_717"></a><a href="#Footnote_717_717" class="fnanchor">[717]</a></p>

<p><b>25. The Testimony of Miracles.</b>&mdash;The Savior's promise in
a former day<a name="FNanchor_718_718" id="FNanchor_718_718"></a><a href="#Footnote_718_718" class="fnanchor">[718]</a> as in the present dispensation<a name="FNanchor_719_719" id="FNanchor_719_719"></a><a href="#Footnote_719_719" class="fnanchor">[719]</a> is definite, to
the effect that specified gifts of the Spirit are to follow the
believer as signs of Divine favor. The possession and exercise
of such gifts may be taken therefore as essential features
of the Church of Christ.<a name="FNanchor_720_720" id="FNanchor_720_720"></a><a href="#Footnote_720_720" class="fnanchor">[720]</a> Nevertheless we are not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
justified in regarding the evidence of miracles as infallible
testimony of authority from heaven; on the other hand,
the scriptures furnish abundant proof that spiritual powers
of the baser sort have wrought miracles, and will continue
so to do, to the deceiving of many who lack discernment.
If miracles be accepted as infallible evidence of godly
power, the magicians of Egypt, through the wonders which
they accomplished in opposition to the ordained plan for
Israel's deliverance, have as good a claim to our respect as
has Moses.<a name="FNanchor_721_721" id="FNanchor_721_721"></a><a href="#Footnote_721_721" class="fnanchor">[721]</a> John the Revelator saw in vision a wicked power
working miracles, and thereby deceiving many; doing great
wonders, even bringing fire from heaven.<a name="FNanchor_722_722" id="FNanchor_722_722"></a><a href="#Footnote_722_722" class="fnanchor">[722]</a> Again, he saw
three unclean spirits, whom he knew to be "the spirits of
devils working miracles."<a name="FNanchor_723_723" id="FNanchor_723_723"></a><a href="#Footnote_723_723" class="fnanchor">[723]</a></p>

<p><b>26.</b> Consider, in connection with this, the prediction
made by the Savior:&mdash;"There shall arise false Christs, and
false prophets, and shall show great signs and wonders,
insomuch that, if it were possible, they shall deceive the
very elect."<a name="FNanchor_724_724" id="FNanchor_724_724"></a><a href="#Footnote_724_724" class="fnanchor">[724]</a> The invalidity of miracles as a proof of
righteousness is declared in an utterance of Christ Jesus
regarding the events of the great judgment:&mdash;"Many will
say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied
in thy name? and in thy name have cast out devils? and
in thy name done many wonderful works? And then will
I profess unto them, I never knew you; depart from me,
ye that work iniquity."<a name="FNanchor_725_725" id="FNanchor_725_725"></a><a href="#Footnote_725_725" class="fnanchor">[725]</a> The Jews, to whom these teachings
were addressed, knew that wonders could be wrought
by evil powers; for they charged Christ with working miracles
by the authority of "Beelzebub the prince of devils."<a name="FNanchor_726_726" id="FNanchor_726_726"></a><a href="#Footnote_726_726" class="fnanchor">[726]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span></p>

<p><b>27.</b> If the working of miracles were a distinctive characteristic
of the holy priesthood, we would look for the
testimony of wondrous manifestations in connection with
the work of every prophet and authorized minister of the
Lord; yet we fail to find a record of miracles in the
case of Zechariah, Malachi, and other prophets of old;
while of John the Baptist, whom Christ declared to be
more than a prophet,<a name="FNanchor_727_727" id="FNanchor_727_727"></a><a href="#Footnote_727_727" class="fnanchor">[727]</a> it was plainly said that he did no
miracle;<a name="FNanchor_728_728" id="FNanchor_728_728"></a><a href="#Footnote_728_728" class="fnanchor">[728]</a> nevertheless, in rejecting John's doctrine, the
unbelievers were ignoring the counsel of God against
their own souls.<a name="FNanchor_729_729" id="FNanchor_729_729"></a><a href="#Footnote_729_729" class="fnanchor">[729]</a> To be valid as a testimony of truth,
miracles must be wrought in the name of Christ, and
to His honor, in furtherance of the plan of salvation.
As stated, they are not given to satisfy the curious and
the lustful, nor as a means of gaining notoriety for him
through whom they are accomplished. These gifts of the
true Spirit are manifested in support of the message from
heaven, and in corroboration of the words spoken by authority.</p>

<p><b>28. Imitations of Spiritual Gifts.</b>&mdash;The proofs already cited
of miraculous achievements by powers other than of God,
and the scriptural predictions concerning such deceptive
manifestations in the last days, ought to be our warning
against spurious imitations of the gifts of the Holy Spirit.
Satan has shown himself to be an accomplished strategist
and a skilful imitator; the most deplorable of his victories
are due to his simulation of good, whereby the
undiscerning have been led captive. Let us not be deluded
with the thought that any act, the immediate result of
which appears to be benign, is necessarily productive of permanent
good. It may serve the dark purposes of man's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
arch-enemy to play upon the human sense of goodness,
even to the extent of healing the body, and apparently of
thwarting death.</p>

<p><b>29.</b> The restoration of the priesthood to earth in this
age of the world was followed by a phenomenal growth of
the vagaries of spiritualism, whereby many have been led to
put their trust in Satan's counterfeit of God's eternal power.
The development of the healing gift in the Church today
is imitated in a degree comparable to that with which the
magicians simulated the miracles of Moses, by the varied
faith cures and their numerous modifications. For those to
whom miraculous signs are all-sufficient, the imitation will
answer as well as would the real; but the soul who regards
the miracle in its true nature as but one element of the system
of Christ, possessing value as a positive criterion only
as it is associated with the numerous other characteristics
of the Church, will not be deceived.</p>

<p><b>30. Spiritual Gifts in the Church Today.</b>&mdash;The Latter-day
Saints claim to possess within the Church all the sign-gifts
promised as the heritage of the believer. They point
to the unimpeached testimonies of thousands who have
been blessed with direct and personal manifestations of
heavenly power; to the once blind, and dumb, halt, and
weak in body, who have been freed from their infirmities
through their faith and by the ministrations of the priesthood;
to a multitude who have voiced their testimony in
tongues with which they were naturally unfamiliar; or who
have demonstrated their possession of the gift by a phenomenal
mastery of foreign languages, when such was necessary
to the discharge of their duties as preachers of the
word of God; to many who have enjoyed communion with
heavenly beings; to others who have prophesied in words
that have found their speedy vindication in literal fulfillment;
and to the Church itself, whose growth has been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
guided by the voice of its Divine Leader, made known
through the gift of revelation.<a name="FNanchor_730_730" id="FNanchor_730_730"></a><a href="#Footnote_730_730" class="fnanchor">[730]</a></p>

<h3>NOTES.</h3>


<blockquote>

<p><b>1. A Seeming Miracle.</b>&mdash;A few years ago, Herr Werner Siemens, a German scientist
of note, visited the pyramid of Gizeh, and, accompanied by a couple of Arab guides,
climbed to the top. He observed that the atmospheric conditions were very favorable to
electric manifestations. Fastening a large brass button to an empty water-gourd in the
hands of one of the Arabs, and then placing his knuckle within a short distance from
the button, he drew therefrom a succession of brilliant sparks, accompanied of course by
the crackling noises characteristic of electric discharges. The guides viewed this exhibition
of supernatural powers with amazement and terror, which reached a climax
when their master stretched his staff above his head, and the stick was surmounted by a
beautiful St. Elmo's flame. This spectacle was more than the superstitious Bedouins
could bear, they trembled before an enchanter who could play with lightning and fire as
with a toy, and who carried miniature thunder in his coat pocket; so they fled down the
steps with dangerous precipitation, and soon disappeared in the desert.</p>

<p><b>2. The Term "Prophet"</b> appears in the English Bible as the translation of a
number of ancient terms, the most usual of which is <i lang="he" xml:lang="he">nabhi</i> (Hebrew), signifying "to
bubble forth like a fountain." Another of the original words is <i lang="el" xml:lang="el">rheo</i> (Greek), meaning
"to flow," and by derivation "to speak forth," "to utter," "to declare." A prophet,
then, is one from whom flow forth the words of a higher authority. Aaron is spoken of as
a prophet or spokesman to Moses (Exo. vii, 1); but in the usual sense, the prophet is the
representative of God. Closely allied with the calling of the prophet is that of the seer;
indeed, at a time prior to that of Samuel, the common designation of the oracle of God
was seer: "for he that is now called a prophet was beforetime called a seer" (I Sam.
ix, 9). The seer was permitted to behold the visions of God, the prophet to declare the
truths so learned; the two callings were usually united in the same person. Unto the
prophet and seer the Lord usually communicated in visions and dreams; but an exception
to this order was made in the case of Moses, who was so faithful and so great in all
things good, that the Lord discarded the usual means and declared Himself to His
servant face to face (Num. xii, 6-8).</p>

<p><b>3. Prophets Organized.</b>&mdash;The prophet's office existed among men in the earliest
periods of history. Adam was a prophet (Doc. and Cov. cvii, 53-56); as also were Enoch
(Jude 14; P. of G. P., Moses vi, 26), Noah (Gen. vi, vii; P. of G. P., Moses viii, 19; II
Peter ii, 5), Abraham (Gen. xx, 7), Moses (Deut. xxxiv, 10), and a multitude of others
who ministered at intermediate and subsequent times. Samuel, who was established in
the eyes of all Israel as a prophet of the Lord (I Sam. iii, 19, 20), organized the prophets
into a society for common instruction and edification. He established schools for the
prophets, theological colleges, where men were trained in things pertaining to holy
offices; the students were generally called "sons of the prophets" (I Kings xx, 35; II
Kings ii, 3, 5, 7; iv, 1, 38; ix, 1). Such schools were established at Ramah (I Sam. xix,
19, 20), Bethel (II Kings ii, 3), Jericho (II Kings ii, 5), Gilgal (II Kings iv, 38). The
members seem to have lived together as a society (II Kings vi, 1-4). In the present dispensation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
a similar organization was effected under the direction of the prophet Joseph
Smith; this also received the name of the School of the Prophets.</p>

<p><b>4. The Decline of Spiritual Gifts in former days</b> is admitted by many
authorities on ecclesiastical history and Christian doctrine. As an instance of this kind
of testimony to the departure of the spiritual graces from the apostate church, the following
words of John Wesley may be applied:&mdash;"It does not appear that these extraordinary
gifts of the Holy Spirit were common in the church for more than two or three centuries.
We seldom hear of them after that fatal period when the emperor Constantine called
himself a Christian, and from a vain imagination of promoting the Christian cause
thereby, heaped riches and power and honor upon Christians in general, but in particular
upon the Christian clergy. From this time they almost totally ceased; very few instances
of the kind were found. The cause of this was not as has been supposed because
there was no more occasion for them,&mdash;because all the world was become Christians.
This is a miserable mistake; not a twentieth part of it was then nominally Christian.
The real cause of it was the love of many, almost all Christians, so called, was waxed
cold. The Christians had no more of the Spirit of Christ than the other heathens. The
Son of Man, when he came to examine His Church, could hardly find faith upon the
earth. This was the real cause why the extraordinary gifts of the Holy Ghost were no
longer to be found in the Christian Church&mdash;because the Christians were turned heathens
again, and only had a dead form left."&mdash;Wesley's Works, vii, 89; 26-27.</p>

<p><b>5. Sectarian Views concerning Continuance or Decline of Spiritual
Gifts.</b>&mdash;"Protestant writers insist that the age of miracles closed with the fourth or
fifth century, and that after that the extraordinary gifts of the Holy Ghost must not be
looked for. Catholic writers, on the other hand, insist that the power to perform miracles
has always continued in the Church; yet those spiritual manifestations which they
describe after the fourth and fifth centuries savor of invention on the part of the priests,
and childish incredulity on the part of the people; or else, what is claimed to be miraculous
falls far short of the power and dignity of those spiritual manifestations which the
primitive church was wont to witness. The virtues and prodigies, ascribed to the bones
and other relics of the martyrs and saints, are puerile in comparison with the healings by
the anointing with oil and the laying on of hands, speaking in tongues, interpretations,
prophecies, revelations, casting out devils in the name of Jesus Christ; to say nothing of
the gifts of faith, wisdom, knowledge, discernment of spirits, etc.&mdash;common in the
Church in the days of the apostles (I Cor. xii, 8-10). Nor is there anything in the
scriptures or in reason that would lead one to believe that they were to be discontinued.
Still this plea is made by modern Christians&mdash;explaining the absence of these spiritual
powers among them&mdash;that the extraordinary gifts of the Holy Ghost were only intended
to accompany the proclamation of the gospel during the first few centuries, until the
church was able to make its way without them, and they were to be done away. It is
sufficient to remark upon this, that it is assumption pure and simple, and stands without
warrant either of scripture or right reason; and proves that men had so far changed the
religion of Jesus Christ that it became a form of godliness without the power thereof."&mdash;Elder
B. H. Roberts, <cite>Outlines of Ecclesiastical History</cite>, part ii, sec. v, 6-8.</p>

<p><b>6. Miracles an Aid to Spiritual Growth.</b>&mdash;Apostle Orson Pratt, commenting
on the utterances of Paul concerning the passing away of certain spiritual gifts (I Cor.
xiii), writes in part as follows:&mdash;"The church in its militant and imperfect state, compared
with its triumphant, immortal, and perfect state, is (in the 11th verse) represented by
the two very different states of childhood and manhood. 'When,' says St. Paul, 'I was a
child, I spake as a child, understood as a child, I thought as a child; but when I became
a man I put away childish things.' In the various stages of education from childhood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
to manhood, certain indispensable rules, and diagrams, and scientific instruments
are employed for the use and benefit of the pupil, that he may acquire a correct knowledge
of the sciences, and be perfected in his studies. When the principles have been
once acquired, and the student has been perfected in every branch of education, he can
dispense with many of his maps, charts, globes, books, diagrams, etc.; as being, like
childish things, no longer necessary; they were useful before his education was perfected,
in imparting the desired knowledge, but having fulfilled their purposes, he no
longer needs their assistance.... So it is with the Church in relation to spiritual
gifts. While in this state of existence it is represented as a child: prophecy, revelations,
tongues, and other spiritual gifts are the instruments of education. The child, or
church, can no more be perfected in its education without the aid of these gifts as instruments,
than the chemist could in his researches if he were deprived of the necessary
apparatus for experiments. As the chemist needs his laboratory for experiments, as long
as there remains any undiscovered truths in relation to the elements and compounds of
our globe, so does the Church need the great laboratory of spiritual knowledge&mdash;namely,
revelation and prophecy,&mdash;as long as it knows only in part.... As a human being,
when a child, speaks as a child, understands as a child, and thinks as a child, so does
the Church in this state of existence know only in part; but as the child, when it
becomes a man, puts away childish things, so will the Church put away such childish
things as 'prophecy in part,' 'knowledge in part,' and 'seeing in part,' when it grows
up, through the aid of these things, to a perfect man in Christ Jesus; that which is in
part will be done away or merged into the greater fulness of knowledge which there
reigns."&mdash;<cite>Divine Authenticity of the Book of Mormon</cite>, i, 15.</p>

<p>But none of these gifts will be done away as long as the occasion for their exercise
continues. That this was the conviction of Apostle Orson Pratt, whose words are quoted
above, is evident from the following utterances by the same authority:&mdash;"The affliction
of devils, the confusion of tongues, deadly poisons and sickness, are all curses which
have been introduced into the world by the wickedness of man. The blessings of the
gospel are bestowed to counteract these curses. Therefore, as long as these curses exist,
the promised signs [Mark xvi, 16-18; Doc. and Cov. lxxxiv, 65-72] are needed to counteract
their evil consequences. If Jesus had not intended that the blessings should be as
extensive and unlimited in point of time as the curses, He would have intimated something
to that effect in His word. But when He makes a universal promise of certain
powers, to enable every believer in the gospel throughout the world to overcome certain
curses, entailed upon man because of wickedness, it would be the rankest kind of infidelity
not to believe the promised blessing necessary, as long as the curses abound among
men."</p>

<p><b>7. Modern Manifestations.</b>&mdash;The official and incidental publications of the
Church abound in instances of miraculous manifestations during the current dispensation.
A number of authenticated accounts with many cases are to be found as follows:&mdash;Orson
Pratt's "Divine Authenticity of the Book of Mormon," chapter v; B. H.
Roberts' "A New Witness for God," chapter xviii.</p>

<h3>THE BIBLE.</h3>

<blockquote>

<p><b>Article 8.</b>&mdash;We believe the Bible to be the word of God, as far as it is translated
correctly....</p></blockquote>


<p><b>1. Our Acceptance of the Bible.</b>&mdash;The Church of Jesus
Christ of Latter-day Saints accepts the Bible as the first and
foremost of her standard works, chief among the books
which have been proclaimed as her written guides in faith
and doctrine. In the respect and sanctity with which the
Latter-day Saints regard the Bible, they are of like profession
with Christian denominations in general, but differ
from them in the additional acknowledgment of certain
other scriptures as authentic and holy, which others are in
harmony with the Bible, and serve to support and emphasize
its facts and doctrines. There is, therefore, no
specifically "Mormon" treatment of the Bible to be presented.
The historical and other data, upon which is based
the current Christian faith as to the genuineness of the
biblical record, are accepted as unreservedly by the Latter-day
Saints as by the members of any sect; and in literalness
of interpretation this Church probably excels.</p>

<p><b>2.</b> Nevertheless, the Church announces a reservation in
the case of erroneous translation, which may occur as a result
of human incapacity; and even in this measure of
caution we are not alone, for biblical scholars generally
admit the presence of errors of the kind, many of them
self-apparent. The Latter-day Saints believe the original
records to be the word of God unto man, and, as far as these
records have been translated correctly, the translations are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
regarded as equally authentic. The English Bible professes
to be a translation made through the wisdom of man; in its
preparation the most scholarly men have been enlisted; yet
not a version has been published in which even the unlearned
cannot perceive errors. However, an impartial investigator
has cause to wonder more at the paucity of errors than that
errors are to be found at all.</p>

<p><b>3.</b> There will be, there can be, no absolutely reliable
translation of these or other scriptures, unless it be effected
through the gift of translation, as one of the endowments of
the Holy Ghost. The translator must have the spirit of
the prophet if he would render in another tongue the
prophet's words; and human wisdom leads not to that possession.
Let the Bible then be read reverently, and with
prayerful care, the reader ever seeking the light of the
Spirit that he may discern between truth and the mistakes
of men.</p>

<p><b>4. The Name "Bible."</b>&mdash;In present usage, the term <em>Holy
Bible</em> designates the collection of sacred writings otherwise
known as the Jewish scriptures, containing an account of
the dealings of God with the human family; which account
is confined wholly, except in the record of ante-diluvian
events, to the eastern hemisphere. The word <em>Bible</em>, though
singular in form, is the English representative of a Greek
plural, <i lang="el" xml:lang="el">Biblia</i>, signifying literally <em>the books</em>. The use of the
word probably dates from the fourth century, at which time
we find Chrysostom<a name="FNanchor_731_731" id="FNanchor_731_731"></a><a href="#Footnote_731_731" class="fnanchor">[731]</a> employing the term to designate the
scriptural books then accepted as canonical by the Greek
Christians. It is to be noted, that the idea of a collection
of books predominates in all early usages of the word
<em>Bible</em>; the scriptures were, as they are, composed of the
special writings of many authors, widely separated in time;
and, from the striking harmony and unity prevailing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
throughout these diverse productions, strong evidence of
their authenticity may be adduced.</p>

<p><b>5.</b> The word <i lang="el" xml:lang="el">Biblia</i> was thus endowed with a special
meaning in the Greek, signifying <em>the books</em>, that is to say the
holy books as distinguishing the sacred scriptures from all
other writings; and the term soon became current in the
Latin, in which tongue it was used from the first in its
special sense. Through Latin usage, perhaps during the
thirteenth century, the word came to be regarded as a
singular noun signifying <em>the book</em>; this departure from the
plural meaning, invariably associated with the term in the
Greek original, led up to the popular error of regarding the
Bible as having been a unified volume from the first. Hence
we meet with the reputed derivation of the word from the
Greek singular noun <i lang="el" xml:lang="el">Biblos</i> meaning <em>the book</em>, but this is
declared by a preponderance of good authority to be founded
on a traditional misconception. It may appear that the
derivation of a word is of trifling importance; yet in this
case, the original form and first use of the title now current
as that of the sacred volume must be of instructive interest,
as throwing some light upon the compilation of the book in
its present form.</p>

<p><b>6.</b> It is evident that the name <em>Bible</em> is not of itself a
biblical term; its use as a designation of the Jewish scriptures
is wholly external to those scriptures themselves. In
its earliest application, which dates from post-apostolic
times, it was made to embrace most if not all the books of
the Old and the New Testament. Prior to the time of
Christ, the books of the Old Testament were known by no
single collective name, but were designated in groups as (1)
the Pentateuch, or five books of the Law; (2) the Prophets;
and (3) the Hagiographa, comprising all sacred records not
included in the other divisions. But we may the better
consider the parts of the Bible by taking the main divisions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
separately. A very natural division of the biblical record is
effected by the earthly work of the Savior; the written productions
of pre-Christian times came to be known as the
Old Covenant; those of the days of the Savior and the years
immediately following, as the New Covenant.<a name="FNanchor_732_732" id="FNanchor_732_732"></a><a href="#Footnote_732_732" class="fnanchor">[732]</a> The term
<em>testament</em> gradually grew in favor until the designations
Old and New Testaments became common.</p>


<p class="center">THE OLD TESTAMENT.</p>

<p><b>7. Its Origin and Growth.</b>&mdash;At the time of our Lord's
ministry in the flesh, the Jews were in possession of certain
scriptures which they regarded as canonical or authoritative.
There can be little doubt as to the authenticity of
those works, for they were frequently quoted by both Christ
and the apostles, by whom they were designated as "the
scriptures."<a name="FNanchor_733_733" id="FNanchor_733_733"></a><a href="#Footnote_733_733" class="fnanchor">[733]</a> The Savior specifically refers to them under
their accepted terms of classification as "the law of Moses,
the prophets, and the psalms."<a name="FNanchor_734_734" id="FNanchor_734_734"></a><a href="#Footnote_734_734" class="fnanchor">[734]</a> The books thus accepted
by the people in the time of Christ are sometimes spoken
of as the Jewish canon of scripture. The term <em>canon</em>,
now generally current, suggests not books that are merely
credible, authentic, or even inspired, but such books as are
recognized as authoritative guides in profession and practice.
The term is instructive in its derivation. Its Greek
original, <i>kanon</i><i lang="el" xml:lang="el">kanon</i>, signified a straight measuring rod, and hence
it came to mean an authoritative standard of comparison, a
rule, or test, as applied to moral subjects as well as to
material objects.</p>

<p><b>8.</b> As to the formation of the Jewish canon, or the Old
Testament, we read that Moses wrote the first part of it,
viz. the Law; and that he committed it to the care of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
priests, or Levites, with a command that they preserve it in
the ark of the covenant,<a name="FNanchor_735_735" id="FNanchor_735_735"></a><a href="#Footnote_735_735" class="fnanchor">[735]</a> to be a witness against Israel in
their transgressions. Fore-seeing that a king would some
day govern Israel, Moses commanded that the monarch
should make a copy of the Law for his guidance.<a name="FNanchor_736_736" id="FNanchor_736_736"></a><a href="#Footnote_736_736" class="fnanchor">[736]</a> Joshua,
successor of Moses, as leader and law-giver of Israel, wrote
further of the dealings of God with the people, and of the
Divine precepts; and this writing he evidently appended to
the Law as recorded by Moses.<a name="FNanchor_737_737" id="FNanchor_737_737"></a><a href="#Footnote_737_737" class="fnanchor">[737]</a> Three centuries and a half
after the time of Moses, when the theocracy had been
replaced by a monarchy, Samuel, the approved prophet of
the Lord, wrote of the change "in a book, and laid it up
before the Lord."<a name="FNanchor_738_738" id="FNanchor_738_738"></a><a href="#Footnote_738_738" class="fnanchor">[738]</a> And thus we see the law of Moses was
augmented by later authoritative records. From the writings
of Isaiah, we learn that the people had access to the
"Book of the Lord;" for the prophet admonished them to
seek it out, and read it.<a name="FNanchor_739_739" id="FNanchor_739_739"></a><a href="#Footnote_739_739" class="fnanchor">[739]</a> It is evident, then, that in the time
of Isaiah the people had a written authority in doctrine and
practice.</p>

<p><b>9.</b> Nearly four centuries later (640-630 B. C.), while
the righteous king Josiah occupied the throne of Judah as
a part of divided Israel, Hilkiah the high priest and father
of the prophet Jeremiah found in the temple "a book of
the law of the Lord,"<a name="FNanchor_740_740" id="FNanchor_740_740"></a><a href="#Footnote_740_740" class="fnanchor">[740]</a> which was read before the kings.<a name="FNanchor_741_741" id="FNanchor_741_741"></a><a href="#Footnote_741_741" class="fnanchor">[741]</a>
Then, during the fifth century B. C., in the days of Ezra,
the edict of Cyrus permitted the captive people of Judah, a
remnant of once united Israel, to return to Jerusalem,<a name="FNanchor_742_742" id="FNanchor_742_742"></a><a href="#Footnote_742_742" class="fnanchor">[742]</a>
there to rebuild the temple of the Lord, according to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
law<a name="FNanchor_743_743" id="FNanchor_743_743"></a><a href="#Footnote_743_743" class="fnanchor">[743]</a> of God then in the hand of Ezra. From this we may
infer that the written law was then known; and to Ezra is
usually attributed the credit of compiling the books of
the Old Testament as far as completed in his day,
to which he added his own writings.<a name="FNanchor_744_744" id="FNanchor_744_744"></a><a href="#Footnote_744_744" class="fnanchor">[744]</a> In this work of compilation
he was probably assisted by Nehemiah and the
members of the Great Synagogue,&mdash;a Jewish college of a
hundred and twenty scholars.<a name="FNanchor_745_745" id="FNanchor_745_745"></a><a href="#Footnote_745_745" class="fnanchor">[745]</a> The book of Nehemiah,
which gives a continuation of the historical story as recorded
by Ezra, is supposed to have been written by the prophet
whose name it bears, in part at least during the life of Ezra.
Then, a century later, Malachi,<a name="FNanchor_746_746" id="FNanchor_746_746"></a><a href="#Footnote_746_746" class="fnanchor">[746]</a> the last of the prophets of
note who flourished before the opening of the dispensation
of Christ, added his record, completing, and virtually closing
the pre-Christian canon, with a prophetic promise of the
Messiah and of the messenger whose commission would be
to prepare the way of the Lord.</p>

<p><b>10.</b> Thus, it is evident that the Old Testament grew with
the successive writings of authorized and inspired scribes
from Moses to Malachi, and that its compilation was a
natural and gradual process, each addition being deposited,
or, as the sacred record gives it, "laid up before the Lord,"
in connection with the previous writings. Undoubtedly
there were known to the Jews many other books, not included
in our present Old Testament; references to such
are abundant in the scriptures themselves, which references
prove that many of those extra-canonical records were regarded
as of great authority. But concerning this we will
enquire further in connection with the Apocrypha. The
recognized canonicity of the Old Testament books is attested<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
by the numerous references in the latter to the earlier
books, and by the many quotations from the Old Testament
occurring in the New. About two hundred and thirty
quotations or direct references have been listed; and in addition
to these, hundreds of less direct allusions occur.</p>

<p><b>11. Language of the Old Testament.</b>&mdash;It is highly probable,
almost certain indeed, that nearly all the books of
the Old Testament were originally written in Hebrew.
Scholars profess to have found evidence that small portions
of the books of Ezra, Daniel, and Jeremiah were written
in the Chaldee language; but the prevalence of Hebrew as
the language of the original scriptures has given to the Old
Testament the common appellation, Hebrew or Jewish
canon. Of the Pentateuch, two versions have been recognized,&mdash;the
Hebrew proper and the Samaritan,<a name="FNanchor_747_747" id="FNanchor_747_747"></a><a href="#Footnote_747_747" class="fnanchor">[747]</a> the latter of
which was preserved in the most ancient of Hebrew characters
by the Samaritans, between whom and the Jews
there was lasting enmity.</p>

<p><b>12. The Septuagint.</b>&mdash;Passing over the Peshito or early
Syriac version of the Old Testament as of minor significance,
we recognize as the first important translation of the
Hebrew canon that known as the <em>Septuagint</em>.<a name="FNanchor_748_748" id="FNanchor_748_748"></a><a href="#Footnote_748_748" class="fnanchor">[748]</a> This was
a Greek version of the Old Testament, translated from the
Hebrew at the instance of an Egyptian monarch, probably
Ptolemy Philadelphus, about 286 B. C. The name <em>Septuagint</em>
suggests the number seventy, and is said to have been
given because the translation was made by a body of seventy-two
elders (in round numbers seventy); or, as other traditions
say, because the work was accomplished in seventy,
or seventy-two days; or, according to yet other stories,
because the version received the sanction of the Jewish
ecclesiastical council, the Sanhedrin, which comprised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
seventy-two members. Certain it is that the Septuagint
(sometimes indicated by the numerals LXX) was the current
version among the Jews in the days of Christ's ministry,
and was quoted by the Savior and the apostles in their
references to the old canon. It is regarded as the most
authentic of the ancient versions, and is accepted at the
present time by the Greek Christians and other eastern
churches. It is evident, then, that from a time nearly three
hundred years before Christ, the Old Testament has been
current in both Hebrew and Greek: this duplication has
been an effective means of protection against alterations.</p>

<p><b>13. The Present Compilation</b> recognizes thirty-nine books
in the Old Testament: these were originally combined as
twenty-two books, corresponding to the letters in the
Hebrew alphabet. The thirty-nine books as at present
constituted may be conveniently classified as follows:</p>


<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="Old Testament">
<tr><td align="left">(1.) The Pentateuch or Books of the Law</td><td align="right">5</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">(2.) The Historical Books</td><td align="right">12</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">(3.) The Poetical Books</td><td align="right">5</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">(4.) The Books of the Prophets</td><td align="right">17</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p><b>14.</b> (1.) <b>The Books of the Law.</b>&mdash;The first five books in the
Bible are collectively designated as the <em>Pentateuch</em> (<em>pente</em>&mdash;five,
<em>teuxos</em>&mdash;volume); and were known among the early
Jews as the <em>Torah</em>, or the law. Their authorship is traditionally
ascribed to Moses,<a name="FNanchor_749_749" id="FNanchor_749_749"></a><a href="#Footnote_749_749" class="fnanchor">[749]</a> and in consequence the "Five
Books of Moses" is another commonly used designation.
They give the history, brief though it be, of the human race
from the creation to the flood, and from Noah to Israel;
then a more particular account of the chosen people through
their period of Egyptian bondage; thence during the journey
of four decades in the wilderness to the encampment on the
farther side of Jordan.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span></p>
<p><b>15.</b> (2.) <b>The Historical Books</b>, twelve in number, comprise
the following: Joshua, Judges, Ruth, I and II
Samuel, I and II Kings, I and II Chronicles, Ezra, Nehemiah,
Esther. They tell the story of the Israelites entering
the land of promise, and their subsequent career through
three distinct periods of their existence as a people:&mdash;(1) as
a theocratic nation, with a tribal organization, all parts
cemented by ties of religion and kinship; (2) as a monarchy,
at first a united kingdom, later a nation divided against
itself; (3) as a partly conquered people, their independence
curtailed by the hand of their victors.</p>

<p><b>16.</b> (3.) <b>The Poetical Books</b> number five: Job, Psalms,
Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, and the Song of Solomon. They
are frequently spoken of as the doctrinal or didactic
works, and the Greek designation Hagiographa (<i lang="el" xml:lang="el">hagios</i>&mdash;holy,
and <i lang="el" xml:lang="el">graphe</i>&mdash;a writing) is still applied.<a name="FNanchor_750_750" id="FNanchor_750_750"></a><a href="#Footnote_750_750" class="fnanchor">[750]</a> These are
of widely different ages, and their close association in the
Bible is probably due to their common use as guides in
devotion amongst the Jewish churches.</p>

<p><b>17.</b> (4.) <b>The Books of the Prophets</b> comprise the five
larger works of Isaiah, Jeremiah, the Lamentations of Jeremiah,
Ezekiel, and Daniel, commonly known as the works
of the <em>Major Prophets</em>; and the twelve shorter books of
Hosea, Joel, Amos, Obadiah, Jonah, Micah, Nahum, Habakkuk,
Zephaniah, Haggai, Zechariah, and Malachi, known
to Bible scholars as the books of the <em>Minor Prophets</em>. These
give the burden of the Lord's word to His people, encouragement,
warning and reproof, as suited their condition, before,
during, and after their captivity.<a name="FNanchor_751_751" id="FNanchor_751_751"></a><a href="#Footnote_751_751" class="fnanchor">[751]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span></p>
<p><b>18. The Apocrypha</b> comprise a number of books of doubtful
authenticity, though such have been at times highly
esteemed. Thus, they were added to the Septuagint, and for
a time were accorded recognition among the Alexandrine
Jews. However, they have never been generally admitted,
being of uncertain origin. They are not quoted in the New
Testament. The designation apocryphal (meaning hidden,
or secret) was first applied to the books by Jerome, because,
said he, "the church doth read [them] for example of life
and instruction of manners, but yet doth it not apply them
to establish any doctrine." The Roman church professes to
acknowledge them as scripture, action to this end having
been taken by the council of Trent (1546); though the
doubt of the authenticity of the works seems still to exist
even among the Roman Catholic authorities. The sixth
article in the Liturgy of the Church of England defines the
orthodox views of the church as to the meaning and intent
of Holy Scripture; and, after specifying the books of the
Old Testament which are regarded as canonical, proceeds in
this wise:&mdash;"And the other books (as Hierome [Jerome]
saith) the church doth read for example of life and instruction
of manners; but yet doth it not apply them to establish
any doctrine; such are these following:&mdash;The Third Book of
Esdras; The Fourth Book of Esdras; The Book of Tobias;
The Book of Judith; The rest of the Book of Esther; The
Book of Wisdom; Jesus, the Son of Sirach; Baruch the
Prophet; The Song of the Three Children; The Story of
Susanna; Of Bel and the Dragon; The Prayer of Manasses;
The First Book of Maccabees; The Second Book of Maccabees."</p>


<p class="center">THE NEW TESTAMENT.</p>

<p><b>19. Its Origin and Authenticity.</b>&mdash;Since the latter part
of the fourth century of our present era, there has arisen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
scarcely a single question of importance regarding the
authenticity of the books of the New Testament as at present
constituted. From that time until the present, the
New Testament has been accepted as an unquestioned
canon of scriptures by all professed Christians.<a name="FNanchor_752_752" id="FNanchor_752_752"></a><a href="#Footnote_752_752" class="fnanchor">[752]</a> In the
fourth century, there were generally current several lists
of the books of the New Testament as we now have them;
of these may be mentioned the catalogues of Athanasius,
Epiphanius, Jerome, Rufinus, and Augustine of Hippo,
and the list announced by the third Council of Carthage.
To these may be added four others, which differ from the
foregoing in omitting the Revelation of John in three
cases, and the same with the Epistle to the Hebrews in
one.</p>

<p><b>20.</b> This superabundance of evidence relating to the
constitution of the New Testament canon in the fourth
century is a result of the anti-Christian persecution of that
period. At the beginning of the century in question, the
oppressive measures of Diocletian, emperor of Rome, were
directed not alone against the Christians as individuals and
as a sect, but against their sacred writings, which the fanatical
and cruel monarch sought to destroy. Some degree
of leniency was extended to those persons who yielded up
the holy books that had been committed to their care; and
not a few embraced this opportunity of saving their lives.
When the rigors of persecution were lessened, the churches
sought to judge their members who had weakened in their
allegiance to the faith, as shown by their surrender of the
scriptures, and all such were anathematized as traitors.
Inasmuch as many books that had been thus given up under
the pressure of threatening death were not at that time
generally accepted as holy, it became a question of first
importance to decide just which books were of such admitted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
sanctity that their betrayal would make a man a traitor.<a name="FNanchor_753_753" id="FNanchor_753_753"></a><a href="#Footnote_753_753" class="fnanchor">[753]</a>
Hence we find Eusebius designating the books of the Messianic
and apostolic days as of two classes:&mdash;(1) Those of
acknowledged canonicity, viz:&mdash;the gospels, the epistles of
Paul, Acts, I John, I Peter, and probably the Apocalypse.
(2) Those of disputed authenticity, viz:&mdash;the epistles of
James, II Peter, II and III John, and Jude. To these
classes he added a third class, including books that were
admittedly spurious.<a name="FNanchor_754_754" id="FNanchor_754_754"></a><a href="#Footnote_754_754" class="fnanchor">[754]</a></p>

<p><b>21.</b> As stated, the list published by Athanasius, which
dates from near the middle of the fourth century, gives the
constitution of the New Testament as we now have it; and
at that time all doubts as to the correctness of the enumeration
seem to have been put to rest; and we find the Testament
of common acceptance by professing Christians in
Rome, Egypt, Africa, Syria, Asia Minor, and Gaul. The
testimony of Origen, who flourished in the third century,
and that of Tertullian, who lived during the second, were
tested and pronounced conclusive by the later writers in
favor of the canonicity of the gospels and the apostolic
writings. Each book was tested on its own merits, and all
were declared by common consent to be authoritative and
binding on the churches.</p>

<p><b>22.</b> If there be need to go farther back, we may note
the testimony of Irenæus, distinguished in ecclesiastical
history as Bishop of Lyons; he lived in the latter half of
the second century, and is known as a disciple of Polycarp,
who was personally associated with the Revelator, John.
His voluminous writings affirm the authenticity of most of
the books of the New Testament, and define their authorship
as at present admitted. To these testimonies may be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
added those of the Saints in Gaul, who wrote to their fellow-sufferers
in Asia, quoting freely from gospels, epistles, and
the Apocalypse;<a name="FNanchor_755_755" id="FNanchor_755_755"></a><a href="#Footnote_755_755" class="fnanchor">[755]</a> the declarations of Melito, Bishop of
Sardis, who journeyed to the East to determine which were
the canonical books, particularly of the Old Testament;<a name="FNanchor_756_756" id="FNanchor_756_756"></a><a href="#Footnote_756_756" class="fnanchor">[756]</a>
and the solemn attest of Justin Martyr, who embraced
Christianity as a result of his earnest and learned investigations,
and who suffered death for his convictions. In
addition to individual testimony, we have that of ecclesiastical
councils and official bodies, by whom the question of
authenticity was tried and decided. In this connection may
be mentioned the Council of Nice, 325 A. D.; the Council of
Laodicea, 363 A. D.; the Council of Hippo, 393 A. D.; the
third and the sixth Councils of Carthage, 397 and 419 A. D.</p>

<p><b>23.</b> Since the date last named, no dispute as to the
authenticity of the New Testament has claimed much attention;
surely the present is too late a time, and the
separating distance today is too vast, to warrant the reopening
of the question. The New Testament must be accepted
for what it claims to be; and though, perhaps, many
precious parts have been suppressed or lost, while some corruptions
of the sacred texts may have crept in, and errors have
been inadvertently introduced through the incapacity of translators,
the volume as a whole must be admitted as authentic
and credible, and as an essential part of the holy scriptures.<a name="FNanchor_757_757" id="FNanchor_757_757"></a><a href="#Footnote_757_757" class="fnanchor">[757]</a></p>

<p><b>24. Classification of the New Testament.</b>&mdash;The New Testament
comprises twenty-seven books, conveniently classified
as:&mdash;</p>


<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="New Testament">
<tr><td align="left">(1.) Historical</td><td align="right">5</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">(2.) Didactic</td><td align="right">21</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">(3.) Prophetic</td><td align="right">1</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span></p>

<p><b>25.</b> (1.) <b>The Historical Books</b> include the four Gospels
and the Acts of the Apostles. The authors of these works
are spoken of as the evangelists Matthew, Mark, Luke, and
John; to Luke is ascribed the authorship of the Acts.</p>

<p><b>26.</b> (2.) <b>The Didactic Books</b> comprise the epistles; and
these we may arrange thus: (<em>1.</em>) <em>The Epistles of Paul</em>, comprising
(<em>a</em>) his doctrinal letters addressed to Romans, Corinthians,
Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians,
Thessalonians, Hebrews; (<em>b</em>) his pastoral communications to
Timothy, Titus, and Philemon. (<em>2.</em>) <i>The General Epistles</i>
of James, Peter, John, and Jude.</p>

<p><b>27.</b> (3.) <b>The Prophetic Works</b>, consisting of the Revelation
of John, commonly known as the Apocalypse.</p>


<p class="center">THE BIBLE AS A WHOLE.</p>

<p><b>28. Early Versions of the Bible.</b>&mdash;Many versions of the
Old Testament and of the combined Testaments have appeared
at different times. The Hebrew text with the
Samaritan duplication of the Pentateuch, and the Greek
translation, or the Septuagint (LXX), have been already
noted. Revisions and modified translations competed for
favor with the Septuagint during the early ages of the
Christian era; Theodotian, Aquila, and Symmachus each
issued a new version. One of the first translations into
Latin was the <em>Italic version</em>, probably prepared in the
second century; this was later improved and amended, and
then became known as the <em>Vulgate</em>; and this is still held by
the church of Rome to be the authentic version. This
version included both Old and New Testaments.</p>

<p><b>29. Many Modern Versions in English</b>, some fragmentary,
others complete, have appeared since the beginning of the
thirteenth century. About 1380 A. D., Wycliffe presented
an English translation of the New Testament, made from
the Vulgate; the Old Testament was afterward added.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
About 1525 A. D., Tyndale's translation of the New Testament
appeared; this was included in Coverdale's Bible,
printed in 1535, which constituted the first version of the
complete Bible. Matthew's Bible dates from 1537; Taverner's
Bible from 1539, and Cranmer's Great Bible from
the same year. In 1560 the Geneva Bible appeared; in
1568 the Bishops' Bible, the first English version having
chapter and verse divisions; and in 1611 the so-called
Authorized English Version, or King James' translation,
this being a new translation of Old and New Testaments
from the Hebrew and Greek, made by forty-seven scholars
at the command of King James I. This has superseded all
earlier versions, and is the form now in current use among
Protestants. But even this latest and supposedly best version
was found to contain many and serious errors; and in
1885 a revised version was issued, which, however, has not
yet been accorded general acceptance.</p>

<p><b>30. Genuineness and Authenticity of the Bible.</b>&mdash;However
interesting and instructive these historical and literary data
of the Jewish scriptures may be, the consideration of such
is subordinate to that of the authenticity of the books; for
as we, in common with the rest of the Christian world, have
accepted them as the word of God, it is eminently proper
that we should inquire into the genuineness of the records
upon which our faith is so largely founded. All evidences
furnished by the Bible itself, such as its language, historical
details, and the consistency of its contents, unite in supporting
its claim to genuineness as the actual works of the
authors to whom the separate parts are ascribed. In a
multitude of instances, comparisons are easy between the
biblical record and contemporary history not scriptural,
particularly in regard to biography and genealogy, and, in
all such cases, striking agreement has been found.<a name="FNanchor_758_758" id="FNanchor_758_758"></a><a href="#Footnote_758_758" class="fnanchor">[758]</a> Further<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
argument exists in the individuality maintained by each
writer, resulting in a marked diversity of style; while the
wondrous unity pervading the whole declares the operation
of some single guiding influence throughout the ages of the
record's growth; and this can be nothing less than the power
of inspiration which operated upon all who were accepted
as instruments in the Divine Hand to prepare this book of
books. Tradition, contemporary history, literary analysis,
and above and beyond all these, the test of prayerful research
and truth-seeking investigation, unite to prove the
authenticity of this wondrous volume, and to point the
way, defined within its covers, leading men back to the
Eternal Presence.</p>

<p><b>31. Book of Mormon Testimony regarding the Bible.</b>&mdash;As
declared in the eighth of the Articles of Faith now under
consideration, the Latter-day Saints accept the Book of
Mormon as a volume of sacred scripture, which, like the
Bible, embodies the word of God. In the next lecture the
Book of Mormon will receive our special attention; but it
may be profitable to refer here to the collateral evidence
furnished by that work regarding the authenticity of the
Jewish scriptures, and of the general integrity of these latter
in their present form. According to the Book of Mormon
record, the Prophet Lehi, with his family and some
others, left Jerusalem by the command of God, about 600
B. C., during the first year of King Zedekiah's reign. Before
finally forsaking the land of their nativity, the travelers
secured certain records, which were engraved on plates
of brass. Among these writings were a history of the Jews
and some of the scriptures then accepted as authentic.</p>

<p><b>32.</b> Lehi examined the brazen record&mdash;"And he beheld
that they did contain the five books of Moses, which
gave an account of the creation of the world, and also of
Adam and Eve, who were our first parents; and also a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
record of the Jews from the beginning, even down to the
commencement of the reign of Zedekiah, king of Judah;
and also the prophecies of the holy prophets, from the beginning,
even down to the commencement of the reign of
Zedekiah; and also many prophecies which have been spoken
by the mouth of Jeremiah."<a name="FNanchor_759_759" id="FNanchor_759_759"></a><a href="#Footnote_759_759" class="fnanchor">[759]</a> This direct reference to the
Pentateuch and to certain of the Jewish prophets is valuable
external evidence concerning the authenticity of those parts
of the biblical record.</p>

<p><b>33.</b> In a vision, Nephi, the son of Lehi, learned of the
future of God's plan regarding the human family; and saw
that a book of great worth, containing the word of God
and the covenants of the Lord with Israel, would go forth
from the Jews to the Gentiles.<a name="FNanchor_760_760" id="FNanchor_760_760"></a><a href="#Footnote_760_760" class="fnanchor">[760]</a> It is further stated that
Lehi's company, who, as we shall see, were led across the
waters to the western continent, whereon they established
themselves and afterward grew to be a numerous and
powerful people, were accustomed to study the scriptures
engraved on the plates of brass; and, moreover, their scribes
embodied long quotations therefrom in their own growing
record.<a name="FNanchor_761_761" id="FNanchor_761_761"></a><a href="#Footnote_761_761" class="fnanchor">[761]</a> So much for Book of Mormon recognition of
the Old Testament, or at least of such parts of the Jewish
canon as had been completed when Lehi's migrating
colony left Jerusalem, during the ministry of the prophet
Jeremiah.</p>

<p><b>34.</b> But further, concerning the New Testament scriptures
this voice from the western world is not silent. In
prophetic vision, many of the Nephite teachers saw and
fore-told the ministry of Christ in the meridian of time, and
recorded predictions concerning the principal events of the
Savior's life and death, with striking fidelity and detail.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
This testimony is recorded of Nephi,<a name="FNanchor_762_762" id="FNanchor_762_762"></a><a href="#Footnote_762_762" class="fnanchor">[762]</a> Benjamin,<a name="FNanchor_763_763" id="FNanchor_763_763"></a><a href="#Footnote_763_763" class="fnanchor">[763]</a> who was
both prophet and king, Abinadi,<a name="FNanchor_764_764" id="FNanchor_764_764"></a><a href="#Footnote_764_764" class="fnanchor">[764]</a> Samuel the converted
Lamanite,<a name="FNanchor_765_765" id="FNanchor_765_765"></a><a href="#Footnote_765_765" class="fnanchor">[765]</a> and others. In addition to these and many
other prophecies regarding the mission of Christ, all of
which agree with the New Testament record of their fulfillment,
we find in the Book of Mormon an account of the
risen Lord's ministrations among the Nephite people, during
which He established His Church with them, after the
pattern recorded in the New Testament; and, moreover, He
gave them many instructions in words almost identical with
those of His teachings among the Jews in the east.<a name="FNanchor_766_766" id="FNanchor_766_766"></a><a href="#Footnote_766_766" class="fnanchor">[766]</a></p>

<h3>NOTES.</h3>


<blockquote>

<p><b>1. John Chrysostom</b>, one of the Greek "Christian Fathers," flourished during
the latter half of the fourth century; he was patriarch of Constantinople, but was deposed
and exiled some time before his death which occurred in 407. His use of the term <i lang="el" xml:lang="el">biblia</i>
to designate the scriptural canon is among the earliest applications of the sort yet found,
He entreated his people to avail themselves of the riches of inspired works in this wise:&mdash;"Hear,
I exhort, all yet in secular life, and purchase <i lang="el" xml:lang="el">biblia</i>, the medicine of the soul."
Speaking of the Jewish Christians, he says, "They have the <i lang="el" xml:lang="el">biblia</i>, but we have the
treasures of the <i lang="el" xml:lang="el">biblia</i>; they have the letters, we have the letters and the understanding."</p>

<p><b>2. The Samaritan Copy of the Pentateuch.</b>&mdash;In his valuable course of
lectures on Bible subjects, Elder David McKenzie presents the following, with references
to the writings of Horne:&mdash;"Nine hundred and seventy years before Christ, the nation
of Israel was divided into two kingdoms. Both retained the same book of the law. Rivalry
prevented either of them from altering or adding to the law. After Israel was carried
into Assyria, other nations occupied Samaria. These received the Pentateuch. (II
Kings xvii, 26-28.) The language being Hebrew or Ph&oelig;nician, whereas the Jewish copy
was changed into Chaldee, corruption or alteration was thus made impracticable, yet the
texts remain almost identical."</p>

<p><b>3. Versions of the Bible or of Parts Thereof.</b>&mdash;<em>The Septuagint</em>:&mdash;"Various
opinions have been put forth to explain its appellation of <em>Septuagint</em>; some say that
Ptolemy Philadelphus requested of Eleazer the High Priest a copy of the Hebrew scriptures,
and six learned Jews from each tribe (together seventy-two), competent to translate
it into Greek; these were shut up in the isle of Pharos, and in seventy-two days they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
completed their task: as they dictated it, Demetrius Phalereus, the king's chief librarian,
transcribed it: but this is now considered a fable. Others say that these same interpreters,
having been shut up in separate cells, wrote each one a translation; and so
extraordinarily did they all coincide together in words as well as sentiment, that evidence
was thus afforded of their inspiration by the Holy Spirit; this opinion has also been set
aside as too extravagant. It is very possible that seventy-two writers were employed in
the translation; but it is more probable that it acquired the name of <em>Septuagint</em> from
having received the approbation of the Jewish Sanhedrin, which consisted of seventy-two
persons. Some affirm it to have been executed at different times; and Horne says
it is most probable that this version was made during the joint reigns of Ptolemy Lagus
and his son Philadelphus, about 285 or 286 B. C."</p>

<p><em>The Vulgate.</em>&mdash;"There was a very ancient version of the Bible translated from the
Septuagint into Latin, but by whom and when is unknown. It was in general use in the
time of Jerome, and was called the <em>Itala</em> or <em>Italic Version</em>. About the close of the fourth
century, Jerome began a new translation into Latin from the Hebrew text, which he
gradually completed. It at last gained the approbation of Pope Gregory I, and has been
used ever since the seventh century. The present Vulgate, declared authentic by the
Council of Trent in the sixteenth century, is the ancient Italic version, revised and improved
by the corrections of Jerome and others; and is the only one allowed by the
Church of Rome."</p>

<p><em>The "Authorized Version."</em>&mdash;"Certain objections having been made to the <em>Bishops'
Bible</em> at the Hampton Court conference in A. D. 1603, King James I directed a new
translation to be made. Forty-seven persons, eminent for their piety and biblical learning,
were chosen to this end; they were divided into six committees, two to sit at Oxford,
two at Cambridge, and two at Westminster; and each committee had a certain portion
of the scriptures assigned to it. They began their task in A. D. 1607, and the whole was
completed and in print in A. D. 1611. This is called the <em>Authorized English Version</em>
and is the one now in use."&mdash;From <cite>Analysis of Scripture History</cite>, by Pinnock; pp. 3,
5; (6th ed.).</p>

<p><b>4. The Prophetical Books</b> of the Old Testament are arranged with little or no
regard to their chronological order, the extent of the contained matter placing the larger
works first. The chronological arrangement would probably be Jonah, Joel, Amos,
Hosea, Isaiah, Micah, Nahum, Zephaniah:&mdash;all of these prophesied previous to the
captivity; then follow Jeremiah, Habakkuk, Ezekiel, and Daniel, who wrote during the
captivity; then Haggai, Zechariah, and Malachi, after the return of the Jews from
captivity.</p>

<p><b>5. Manuscript Copies of the New Testament.</b>&mdash;Three manuscripts of New
Testament writings now in existence are regarded as authentic. These are known as the
<em>Vatican</em> (now in Rome), the <em>Alexandrian</em> (now in London), and the <em>Sinaitic</em> (now in the
St. Petersburg library). The last named or Sinaitic is considered to be the oldest copy
of the New Testament in existence. The manuscript was discovered in 1859 among the
archives of a monastery on Mount Sinai, hence its name. It was found by Tischendorf,
and is now in the imperial library at St. Petersburg.</p>

<p><b>6. Concerning the Genuineness of Parts of the New Testament.</b>&mdash;In
answer to objections that have been urged by critics in the matter of genuineness or
authenticity of certain books of the New Testament, the following array of testimony
may be considered. The items are presented here as collated by Elder David McKenzie,
and as used by him in his instructive lectures on the Bible.</p>

<p>(<em>I</em>) <em>The Four Gospels.</em>&mdash;<em>1. Matthew.</em> Papias, Bishop of Hierapolis, was a hearer of the
Apostle John. With respect to St. Matthew's Gospel, Eusebius quotes him as saying:&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>"Matthew composed the Oracles In the Hebrew tongue, and each one interpreted them
as he could."&mdash;(Eusebius, Hist. Eccl. iii, 39.)</p>

<p><em>2. Mark.</em> Of Mark's writing, Papias also says:&mdash;"Mark having become the interpreter
of Peter, wrote down accurately everything that he remembered, without, however,
recording in order what was either said or done by Christ. For neither did he hear the
Lord, nor follow Him, but afterward attended Peter, who adapted his instructions to the
needs of his hearers, but had no design of giving a connected account of the Lord's
oracles (or discourses)."&mdash;(Bishop Lightfoot's translations, in "Contemporary Review,"
August, 1875.)</p>

<p><em>3. Luke.</em> Internal evidence shows that Luke's Gospel and the Acts of the Apostles
were composed by the same author. St. Paul speaks of Luke as a physician; and Dr.
Hobart, in 1882, published at London a treatise on "The Medical Language of St. Luke,"
and points out the frequent use of medical terms in Luke's writings, permeating the
entire extent of the third Gospel, and the Acts of the Apostles. Even M. Renan makes
a similar admission. He says:&mdash;"One point which is beyond question is that the Acts
are by the same author as the third Gospel, and are a continuation of that Gospel. One
need not stop to prove this proposition, which has never been seriously contested. The
prefaces at the commencement of each work, the dedication of each to Theophilus, the
perfect resemblance of style and of ideas, furnish on this point abundant demonstrations."
"A second proposition is that the author of the Acts is a disciple of Paul, who accompanied
him for a considerable part of his travels."&mdash;(M. Renan, "The Apostles";
see preface.)</p>

<p><em>4. John.</em> Irenæus, Bishop of Lyons, about 177 A. D., a pupil of Polycarp who was
martyred in 155 or 156, relates in a letter to a fellow-pupil his recollections of what he
had heard Polycarp say about his intercourse with John, and with the rest who had seen
the Lord; and about the Lord, and about His miracles, and about His teaching. All
these he would relate altogether in accordance with <em>the Scriptures</em>. (Eusebius, Eccl.
Hist, v, 20.) That Irenæus meant by "the Scriptures," Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John,
is evident from the text. Besides, he urges "not only that four Gospels alone have been
handed down from the beginning, but that in the nature of things there could not be
more nor less than four. There are four regions in the world, and four principal winds,
and the Church therefore, as destined to be conterminous with the world, must be supported
by four Gospels as four pillars."&mdash;(Contemporary Review, August, 1876, p. 413.)
[The forced analogy assumed by Irenæus between the <em>four</em> Gospels and the <em>four</em> winds,
etc., is of course without foundation, and its use appears literally absurd; nevertheless
the fact that he noted it furnishes evidence of the acceptance of the four Gospels in his
day.&mdash;J. E. T.]</p>

<p>(<em>II</em>) <em>The Pauline Epistles.</em>&mdash;The following extracts from the testimony of the
Tübingen critics on four of Paul's epistles, are instructive.</p>

<p>De Wette says, in his introduction to the "Books of the New Testament" (123, a.):&mdash;"The
letters of Paul bear the marks of his powerful genius. The most important of
them are raised above all contradiction as to their authenticity; they form the solid
kernel of the book of the New Testament."</p>

<p>Baur says, in his "Apostle Paul" (1, 8):&mdash;"Not only has no suspicion of the authenticity
of these Epistles even arisen, but they bear so incontestably the seal of the originality
of Paul, that one cannot comprehend for what reason critics could raise any
objection to them."</p>

<p>Weizsæker writes (Apost. Zeitalter, 1866, p. 190):&mdash;"The letters to the Galatians and
the Corinthians are, without doubt, from the hand of the Apostle; from his hand also
came incontestably the Epistle to the Romans."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span></p>

<p>Holtzmann says ("Einleit in's N. T.," p. 224):&mdash;"These four Epistles are the Pauline
Homologoumena (books universally received) in the modern acceptation of the word. We
can realize, with respect to them, the proof of authenticity undertaken by Paley against
the free-thinkers of his time."</p>

<p>M. Renan in <em>The Gospels</em> (pp. 40, 41), thus expresses himself:&mdash;"The epistles of
Paul have an unequaled advantage in this history&mdash;that is, their absolute authenticity."
Of the Epistles to the Corinthians, the Galatians, and the Romans, Renan speaks as "indisputable
and undisputed;" and adds, "The most severe critics, such as Christian Baur,
accept them without objection."</p>

<p><b>7. Archeological Evidence Confirming the Bible.</b>&mdash;Prof. A. H. Sayce,
M. A., sums up his learned treatise on the testimony of the ancient monuments, thus:&mdash;"The
critical objections to the truth of the Old Testament, once drawn from the armory
of Greek and Latin writers, can never be urged again; they have been met and overthrown
once for all. The answers to them have come from papyrus and clay and stone,
from the tombs of ancient Egypt, from the mounds of Babylonia, and from the ruined
palaces of the Assyrian kings."</p>

<p><b>8. Missing Scripture.</b>&mdash;Those who oppose the doctrine of continual revelation
between God and His Church, on the ground that the Bible is complete as a collection of
sacred scriptures, and that alleged revelation not found therein must therefore be spurious,
may profitably take note of the many books not included in the Bible, yet mentioned
therein, generally in such a way as to leave no doubt that they were once regarded as
authentic. Among these extra-biblical scriptures, the following may be named; some
of them are in existence to-day, and are classed with the Apocrypha; but the greater
number are unknown. We read of the Book of the Covenant (Exo. xxiv, 7); Book of
the Wars of the Lord (Numb. xxi, 14); Book of Jasher (Josh. x, 13); Book of the
Statutes (I Sam. x, 25); Book of Enoch (Jude 14); Book of the Acts of Solomon (I Kings
xi, 41); Book of Nathan the Prophet, and that of Gad the Seer (I Chron. xxix, 29);
Book of Ahijah the Shilonite, and visions of Iddo, the Seer (II Chron. ix, 29); Book of
Shemaiah (II Chron. xii, 15); Story of the Prophet Iddo (II Chron. xiii, 22); Book of Jehu
(II Chron. xx, 34); the Acts of Uzziah, by Isaiah, the son of Amoz (II Chron. xxvi, 22);
Sayings of the Seers (II Chron. xxxiii, 19); a missing epistle of Paul to the Corinthians (I
Cor. v, 9); a missing epistle to the Ephesians (Eph. iii, 3); missing epistle to the Colossians,
written from Laodicea (Col. iv, 16); a missing epistle of Jude (Jude 3); a declaration
of belief mentioned by Luke (i, 1).</p></blockquote>

<p class="center">DESCRIPTION AND ORIGIN.</p>

<p><b>1. What is the Book of Mormon?</b>&mdash;The claims made for
the Book of Mormon affirm it to be a divinely inspired
record, made by the prophets of the ancient peoples who
inhabited the American continent for centuries before and
immediately after the time of Christ; which record has been
translated in the present generation through the gift of
God and by His special appointment. The authorized and
inspired translator of these sacred scriptures, through whose
instrumentality they have been given to the world in modern
language, is Joseph Smith, whose first acquaintance with
the plates was mentioned in the first lecture.<a name="FNanchor_767_767" id="FNanchor_767_767"></a><a href="#Footnote_767_767" class="fnanchor">[767]</a> As stated,
on the 21st of September, 1823, Joseph Smith received, in
answer to fervent prayer, a visitation from an angelic
personage, who gave his name as Moroni; subsequent revelations
showed him to be the last of a long line of prophets
whose translated writings constitute the Book of Mormon;
by him the ancient records had been closed; by him the
graven plates had been deposited in the earth; and through
his ministration they were brought into the possession of
the modern prophet and seer whose work of translation is
now before us.</p>

<p><b>2.</b> On the occasion of Moroni's first visit to Joseph
Smith, the angelic visitor declared the existence of the
record, which, he said, was engraved on plates of gold,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
at that time lying buried in the side of a hill near Joseph's
home. The hill, which was known by one division of the
ancient peoples as Cumorah, by another as Ramah, is situated
near Palmyra in the county of Wayne, State of New
York. The precise spot where the plates lay was shown to
Joseph in vision; and he had no difficulty in finding it on
the day following the visitation referred to. Joseph's statement
of Moroni's declaration concerning the plates is as follows:&mdash;"He
said there was a book deposited, written upon
gold plates, giving an account of the former inhabitants of
this continent, and the source from which they sprang.
He also said that the fulness of the everlasting gospel was
contained in it, as delivered by the Savior to the ancient
inhabitants. Also, that there were two stones in silver bows,
(and these stones, fastened to a breastplate, constituted
what is called the Urim and Thummim), deposited with the
plates; and the possession and use of these stones was what
constituted Seers in ancient or former times; and that God
had prepared them for the purpose of translating the
book."<a name="FNanchor_768_768" id="FNanchor_768_768"></a><a href="#Footnote_768_768" class="fnanchor">[768]</a></p>

<p><b>3.</b> Joseph found a large stone at the indicated spot on
the hill Cumorah; beneath the stone was a box, also of
stone; the lid of this he raised by means of a lever; then he
saw within the box the plates, and the breastplate with the
Urim and Thummim, as described by the angel. As he was
about to remove the contents of the box, Moroni again appeared
before him, and forbade him taking the sacred things
at that time, saying that four years must pass before they
would be committed to his personal care; and that, in the
meantime, Joseph would be required to visit the place at
yearly intervals; this the youthful revelator did, receiving
on each occasion additional instruction concerning the
record and God's purposes with it. On the 22nd of September,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
1827, Joseph received from the angel Moroni the
plates and the Urim and Thummim with the breastplate.
He was instructed to guard them with strict care, and was
promised that if he used his best efforts to protect them
they would be preserved inviolate in his hands; and that on
the completion of the labor of translation, Moroni would
visit him again, and receive the plates.</p>

<p><b>4.</b> The reason prompting the angelic caution regarding
Joseph's care of the treasures soon appeared; thrice in the
course of his short journey homeward with the sacred relics,
he was attacked; but by Divine aid he was enabled to withstand
his assailants and finally reached his home with the
plates and other articles unharmed. These attacks were but
the beginning of a siege of persecution which was relentlessly
waged against him by the powers of evil as long as the
plates remained in his custody. News that he had the
golden record in his possession soon spread; and numerous
attempts, many of them violent, were made to wrest the
plates from his hands. But they were preserved; and,
slowly, with many hindrances incident to persecution by
the wicked, and to the conditions of his own poverty which
made it necessary for him to toil and left little leisure for
the appointed labor, Joseph proceeded with the translation;
and in 1830 the Book of Mormon was first published to the
world.</p>

<p><b>5. The Title Page of the Book of Mormon.</b>&mdash;Our best
answer to the question: What is the Book of Mormon? is
found on the title page to the volume. Thereon we read:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The Book of Mormon: an account written by the hand of
Mormon, upon plates taken from the plates of Nephi.
Wherefore it is an abridgment of the record of the people of
Nephi, and also of the Lamanites; written to the Lamanites
who are a remnant of the house of Israel; and also to Jew
and Gentile: written by way of commandment, and also by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
the spirit of prophecy and of revelation. Written and
sealed up, and hid up unto the Lord, that they might not
be destroyed; to come forth by the gift and power of God
unto the interpretation thereof: sealed by the hand of
Moroni, and hid up unto the Lord, to come forth in due
time by the way of Gentile; the interpretation thereof by
the gift of God.</p>

<p>"An abridgment taken from the book of Ether also;
which is a record of the people of Jared; who were scattered
at the time the Lord confounded the language of the people
when they were building a tower to get to heaven;
which is to show unto the remnant of the House of Israel
what great things the Lord hath done for their fathers; and
that they may know the covenants of the Lord, that they
are not cast off forever; and also to the convincing of the
Jew and Gentile that Jesus is the Christ, the Eternal God,
manifesting Himself unto all nations. And now, if there
are faults, they are the mistakes of men: wherefore condemn
not the things of God, that ye may be found spotless at
the judgment seat of Christ."</p></blockquote>

<p>This combined title and preface is a translation from the
last page of the plates, and was presumably written by
Moroni, who, as before stated, sealed and hid up the book
in former days.<a name="FNanchor_769_769" id="FNanchor_769_769"></a><a href="#Footnote_769_769" class="fnanchor">[769]</a></p>

<p><b>6. Main Divisions of the Book.</b>&mdash;From the title page, we
learn that in the Book of Mormon we have to deal with the
histories of two great nations, who flourished in America as
the descendants of small colonies brought hither from the
eastern continent by Divine direction. Of these we may
conveniently speak as the Nephites and the Jaredites.</p>

<p><b>7. The Nephite Nation</b> was the later, and in point of the
fulness of the records, the more important. The progenitors
of this nation were led from Jerusalem 600 B. C., by
Lehi, a Jewish prophet of the tribe of Manasseh. His immediate
family, at the time of their departure from Jerusalem,
comprised his wife Sariah, and their sons Laman,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
Lemuel, Sam, and Nephi; at a later stage of the history,
daughters are mentioned, but whether any of these were
born before the family exodus we are not told. Beside his
own family, the colony of Lehi included Zoram and Ishmael,
the latter an Israelite of the tribe of Ephraim. Ishmael,
with his family, joined Lehi in the wilderness; and
his descendants were numbered with the nation of whom
we are speaking. The company journeyed somewhat east
of south, keeping near the borders of the Red Sea; then,
changing their course to the eastward, crossed the peninsula
of Arabia; and there, on the shores of the Arabian Sea,
built and provisioned a vessel in which they committed
themselves to Divine care upon the waters. Their voyage
carried them eastward across the Indian Ocean, then over
the south Pacific Ocean to the western coast of South
America, whereon they landed (590 B. C.). The landing
place is not described with such detail as to warrant definite
conclusions.</p>

<p><b>8.</b> The people established themselves on what to them
was the land of promise; many children were born, and in
the course of a few generations a numerous posterity held
possession of the land. After the death of Lehi, a division
occurred, some of the people accepting as their leader
Nephi, who had been duly appointed to the prophetic office;
while the rest proclaimed Laman, the eldest of Lehi's
sons, as their chief. Henceforth the divided people were
known as Nephites and Lamanites respectively. At times
they observed toward each other fairly friendly relations;
but generally they were opposed, the Lamanites manifesting
implacable hatred and hostility toward their Nephite kindred.
The Nephites advanced in the arts of civilization,
built large cities, and established prosperous commonwealths;
yet they often fell into transgression; and the Lord
chastened them by permitting their foes to be victorious.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
They spread northward, occupying the northern part of
South America; then, crossing the Isthmus, they extended
their domain over the southern, central, and eastern portions
of what is now the United States of America. The Lamanites,
while increasing in numbers, fell under the curse of
darkness; they became dark in skin and benighted in spirit,
forgot the God of their fathers, lived a wild nomadic life,
and degenerated into the fallen state in which the American
Indians,&mdash;their lineal descendants,&mdash;were found by those
who re-discovered the western continent in later times.</p>

<p><b>9.</b> The final struggles between Nephites and Lamanites
were waged in the vicinity of the hill Cumorah,
in what is now the state of New York, resulting in the
entire destruction of the Nephites, about 400 A. D. The last
Nephite representative was Moroni, who, wandering for
safety from place to place, daily expecting death from the
victorious Lamanites, who had decreed the absolute extinction
of their white kindred, wrote the concluding parts of
the Book of Mormon, hid the record in Cumorah, and
soon thereafter died. It was this same Moroni who, as a
resurrected being, gave the records into the hands of Joseph
Smith in the present dispensation.</p>

<p><b>10. The Jaredite Nation.</b>&mdash;Of the two nations whose
histories constitute the Book of Mormon, the first in order
of time consisted of the people of Jared, who followed their
leader from the Tower of Babel at the time of the confusion
of tongues. Their history was written on twenty-four
plates of gold by Ether, the last of their prophets, who,
fore-seeing the destruction of his people because of their
wickedness, hid away the historical plates. They were
afterward found, B. C. 123, by an expedition sent out by
King Limhi, a Nephite ruler. The record engraved on
these plates was subsequently abridged by Moroni, and the
condensed account was attached by him to the Book of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
Mormon record; it appears in the modern translation under
the name of the Book of Ether.</p>

<p><b>11.</b> The first and chief prophet of the Jaredites is not
mentioned by name in the record as we have it; he is known
only as the brother of Jared. Of the people, we learn that,
amid the confusion of Babel, Jared and his brother importuned
the Lord that He would spare them and their
associates from the impending disruption. Their prayer
was heard, and the Lord led them with a considerable company,
who, like themselves, were free from the taint of
idolatry, away from their homes, promising to conduct them
to a land choice above all other lands. Their course of
travel is not given with exactness; we learn only that they
reached the ocean, and there constructed eight vessels,
called barges, in which they set out upon the waters. These
vessels were small and dark within; but the Lord made
luminous certain stones, which gave light to the imprisoned
voyagers. After a passage of three hundred and forty-four
days, the colony landed on the western shore of North
America, possibly south of the Gulf of California, and
north of the Isthmus of Panama.</p>

<p><b>12.</b> Here they became a flourishing nation; but, giving
way in time to internal dissensions, they divided into factions,
which warred with one another until the people were
totally destroyed. This destruction, which occurred near
the hill Ramah, afterward known among the Nephites as
Cumorah, probably took place at about the time of Lehi's
landing in South America,&mdash;590 B. C. The last representative
of the ill-fated race was Coriantumr, the former king,
concerning whom Ether had prophesied that he should
survive all his subjects, and live to see another people in
possession of the land. This prediction was fulfilled in that
the king, whose people had become extinct, came, in the
course of his solitary wanderings, to a region occupied by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
the people of Mulek, who are to be mentioned here as the
third ancient colony of emigrants from the eastern continent.</p>

<p><b>13.</b> <em>Mulek</em>, we are told, was the son of Zedekiah, king of
Judah, an infant at the time of his brothers' violent deaths
and his father's cruel torture at the hands of the king of
Babylon.<a name="FNanchor_770_770" id="FNanchor_770_770"></a><a href="#Footnote_770_770" class="fnanchor">[770]</a> Eleven years after Lehi's departure from Jerusalem,
another colony was led from the city, amongst whom
was Mulek. His name has been given to the people, probably
on account of his recognized rights of leadership by
virtue of his lineage. The Book of Mormon record concerning
Mulek and his people is scant; we learn, however,
that the colony was brought across the waters, to a landing
on the northern part of the continent. The descendants of
this colony were discovered by the Nephites under Mosiah;
they had grown numerous, but, having had no scriptures for
their guidance, had fallen into a condition of spiritual darkness.
They joined the Nephites, and their history is merged
into that of the greater nation.<a name="FNanchor_771_771" id="FNanchor_771_771"></a><a href="#Footnote_771_771" class="fnanchor">[771]</a> The Nephites gave to
North America the name Land of Mulek.</p>


<p class="center">THE ANCIENT PLATES AND THE MODERN TRANSLATION.</p>

<p><b>14. The Plates of the Book of Mormon</b> as delivered by
the angel Moroni to Joseph Smith, according to the description
given by the modern prophet, were of gold, of uniform
size, each about seven inches wide by eight inches long; in
thickness a little less than ordinary sheet tin; they were
fastened together by three rings running through the plates
near one edge; together they formed a book nearly six
inches in thickness, but not all has been translated, a part
being sealed. Both sides of the plates were engraved with
small and beautiful characters, described by those who examined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
them as of curious workmanship, with the appearance
of ancient origin.</p>

<p><b>15.</b> Three classes of plates are mentioned on the title
page of the Book of Mormon, viz:&mdash;</p>

<p>(1.) <i>The Plates of Nephi</i>, which, as will be shown, were
of two kinds:&mdash;(a) the larger plates; (b) the smaller plates.</p>

<p>(2.) <em>The Plates of Mormon</em>, containing an abridgment
from the plates of Nephi, with additions made by Mormon
and his son Moroni.</p>

<p>(3.) <em>The Plates of Ether</em>, containing, as we have seen,
the history of the Jaredites.</p>

<p>To these may be added another set of plates, as being
mentioned in the Book of Mormon, viz:</p>

<p>(4.) <em>The Brass Plates of Laban</em>, brought by Lehi's
people from Jerusalem, and containing Jewish scriptures
and genealogies, many extracts from which appear in the
Nephite records. We have now to consider more particularly
the plates of Nephi, and Mormon's abridgment thereof.</p>

<p><b>16. The Plates of Nephi</b> are so named from the fact that
they were prepared, and their record was begun, by Nephi,
the son of Lehi. These plates were of two kinds,<a name="FNanchor_772_772" id="FNanchor_772_772"></a><a href="#Footnote_772_772" class="fnanchor">[772]</a> which
may be distinguished as the "larger plates" and the
"smaller plates." Nephi began his labors as a recorder by
engraving on plates of gold a historical account of his
people, from the time his father left Jerusalem. This
account recited the story of their wanderings, their prosperity
and their distress, the reigns of their kings, and the
wars and contentions of the people; the record was in the
nature of a secular history. These plates were handed
from one recorder to another throughout the generations of
the Nephite people; so that, at the time they were abridged
by Mormon, the record covered a period of about a thousand
years, dating from 600 B. C., the time of Lehi's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
exodus from Jerusalem. Although these plates bore the
name of their maker, who was also the first of the writers,
the separate work of each recorder is known in general by
his specific name, so that the record is made up of many
distinct books.</p>

<p><b>17.</b> By command of the Lord, Nephi made other plates,
upon which he recorded particularly the ecclesiastical history
of his people, citing only such instances of other events
as seemed necessary to the proper sequence of the narrative.
"I have received a commandment of the Lord," says Nephi,
"that I should make these plates for the special purpose
that there should be an account engraven of the ministry of
my people."<a name="FNanchor_773_773" id="FNanchor_773_773"></a><a href="#Footnote_773_773" class="fnanchor">[773]</a> The object of this double line of history was
unknown to Nephi, it was enough for him that the Lord
required the labor; that it was for a wise purpose will be
shown.</p>

<p><b>18. Mormon's Abridgment.</b>&mdash;In the course of time the
records that had accumulated as the history of the people
grew fell into the hands of Mormon;<a name="FNanchor_774_774" id="FNanchor_774_774"></a><a href="#Footnote_774_774" class="fnanchor">[774]</a> and he undertook to
make an abridgment of these extensive works, upon plates
made with his own hands.<a name="FNanchor_775_775" id="FNanchor_775_775"></a><a href="#Footnote_775_775" class="fnanchor">[775]</a> By such a course, a record was
prepared more concise and more nearly uniform in style,
language, and treatment than could possibly be the case
with the varied writings of so many authors as had contributed
to the great history during the thousand years of its
growth. Mormon recognizes and testifies to the inspiration
of God by which he was moved to undertake the great
labor.<a name="FNanchor_776_776" id="FNanchor_776_776"></a><a href="#Footnote_776_776" class="fnanchor">[776]</a> In preparing this shorter history, Mormon preserved
the division of the record into books according to the arrangement
of the originals; and thus, though the language
may be that of Mormon, except in cases of quotations from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
the plates of Nephi, which are indeed numerous, we find the
Books of Nephi, the Book of Alma, the Book of Helaman,
etc., the form of speech known as the first person being
generally preserved.</p>

<p><b>19.</b> When Mormon, in the course of his abridgment, had
reached the time of King Benjamin's reign, he was deeply
impressed with the record engraved on the smaller plates of
Nephi,&mdash;the history of God's dealings with the people
during the period of about four centuries, extending from
the time of Lehi's exodus from Jerusalem down to the time
of King Benjamin. This record, comprising so much of
prophecy concerning the mission of the Savior, was regarded
by Mormon with more than ordinary favor. Of these plates
he attempted no transcript, but included the originals with
his own abridgment of the larger plates, making of the
two one book. The record as compiled by Mormon contained,
therefore, a double account of the descendants of
Lehi for the first four hundred years of their history,&mdash;the
brief secular history condensed from the larger plates, and
the full text on the smaller plates. In solemn language, and
with an emphasis which subsequent events have shown to
be significant, Mormon declares the hidden wisdom of the
Divine purpose in this duplication:&mdash;"And I do this for a
wise purpose; for thus it whispereth me, according to the
workings of the Spirit of the Lord which is in me. And
now, I do not know all things; but the Lord knoweth all
things which are to come; wherefore, he worketh in me to
do according to his will."<a name="FNanchor_777_777" id="FNanchor_777_777"></a><a href="#Footnote_777_777" class="fnanchor">[777]</a></p>

<p><b>20. The Lord's Purpose</b> in the matter of preparing and of
preserving the smaller plates as testified of by Mormon, and
also by Nephi,<a name="FNanchor_778_778" id="FNanchor_778_778"></a><a href="#Footnote_778_778" class="fnanchor">[778]</a> is rendered plain from certain circumstances
in this dispensation attending the translation of the records<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
by Joseph Smith. When the prophet had prepared a
translation of the first part of the writings of Mormon, the
manuscript was won from his care through the unrighteous
solicitations of Martin Harris, to whom he considered himself
in a degree indebted for financial assistance in the
work of publication. This manuscript, in all 116 pages,
was never returned to Joseph; but, through the dark
schemes of evil powers, it fell into the hands of enemies,
who straightway laid a wicked plan to ridicule the translator
and thwart the purposes of God. This evil design was
that they wait until Joseph had re-translated the missing
matter, when the stolen manuscript, which in the meantime
had been altered so that the words were made to express the
contrary from the true record, would be set forth as a proof
that the prophet was unable to translate the same passages
twice alike. But the Lord's wisdom interposed to bring to
naught these dark designs.</p>

<p><b>21.</b> Having chastened the prophet by depriving him for
a season of his gift to translate, as also of the custody of
the sacred records, and this for his dereliction in permitting
the writings to pass into unappointed hands, the Lord
graciously restored His penitent servant to favor, and revealed
to him the designs of his enemies;<a name="FNanchor_779_779" id="FNanchor_779_779"></a><a href="#Footnote_779_779" class="fnanchor">[779]</a> at the same time
showing how these evil machinations should be made to fail.
Joseph was instructed, therefore, not to attempt a re-translation
of that part of Mormon's abridgment, the first translation
of which had been stolen; but instead, to translate the
record of the same events from the plates of Nephi,&mdash;the set
of smaller plates which Mormon had incorporated with his
own writings. The translation so made was therefore published
as the record of Nephi, and not as the writing of
Mormon; and thus no second translation was made of the
parts from which the stolen manuscript had been prepared.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span></p>
<p><b>22. The Translation of the Book of Mormon</b> was effected
through the power of God manifested in the bestowal of the
gift of revelation. The book professes not to be dependent
upon the wisdom or learning of man; its translator was not
versed in linguistics; his qualifications were of a different
and of a far more efficient order. With the plates, Joseph
Smith received from the angel other sacred treasures, including
a breastplate, to which were attached the Urim and
Thummim,<a name="FNanchor_780_780" id="FNanchor_780_780"></a><a href="#Footnote_780_780" class="fnanchor">[780]</a> called by the Nephites <em>Interpreters</em>; and by
the use of these he was enabled to render the ancient records
in our modern tongue. The details of the work of translation
have not been authentically recorded beyond the statement
that the translator examined the engraved characters
by means of the sacred instruments, and then dictated to the
scribe the English sentences.</p>

<p><b>23.</b> Joseph began his work with the plates by patiently
copying a number of characters, adding to some of the pages
thus prepared the translations. The prophet's first assistant
in the labor, Martin Harris, obtained permission to take
away some of these transcripts, with the purpose of submitting
them to the examination of men learned in ancient
languages. He placed some of the sheets before Professor
Charles Anthon, of Columbia College, who, after careful
examination, certified that the characters were in general of
the ancient Egyptian order, and that the accompanying
translations appeared to be correct. Hearing how this
ancient record came into Joseph's hands, Professor Anthon
requested Mr. Harris to bring the original book for examination,
stating that he would undertake the translation of the
entire work; then, learning that a part of the book was sealed,
he remarked, "I cannot read a sealed book"; and thus unwittingly
did this man fulfill the prophecy of Isaiah concerning
the coming forth of the volume:&mdash;"And the vision of all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
is become unto you as the words of a book that is sealed,
which men deliver to one that is learned, saying, read
this, I pray thee, and he saith, I cannot, for it is sealed."<a name="FNanchor_781_781" id="FNanchor_781_781"></a><a href="#Footnote_781_781" class="fnanchor">[781]</a> Another
linguist, a Dr. Mitchell, of New York, having examined
the characters, gave concerning them a testimony in all
important respects corresponding to that of Prof. Anthon.</p>

<p><b>24. Arrangement of the Book of Mormon.</b>&mdash;The Book of
Mormon comprises fifteen separate parts, commonly called
books, distinguished by the names of their principal authors.
Of these, the first six books, viz., I and II Nephi, Jacob,
Enos, Jarom, and Omni, are literal translations from corresponding
portions of the smaller plates of Nephi. The
body of the volume, from the Book of Mosiah to Mormon,
chapter vii, inclusive, is the translation of Mormon's
abridgment of the larger plates of Nephi. Between the
books of Omni and Mosiah "The Words of Mormon"
occur, connecting the record of Nephi, as engraved on the
smaller plates, with Mormon's abridgment of the larger
plates for the periods following. The Words of Mormon
may be regarded as a brief explanation of the preceding
portions of the work, and a preface of the parts then
to follow. The last part of the Book of Mormon, from
the beginning of Mormon viii to the end of the volume,
is in the language of Moroni, the son of Mormon, who
first proceeds to finish the record of his father, and then
adds an abridgment of a set of plates which contained an account

<p><b>25.</b> At the time of Moroni's writing he stood alone,&mdash;the
sole surviving representative of his people. The last of
the terrible wars between Nephites and Lamanites had
resulted in the annihilation of the former as a people; and
Moroni supposed that his abridgment of the Book of Ether<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
would be his last literary work; but, finding himself miraculously
preserved at the conclusion of that undertaking, he
added the parts known to us as the Book of Moroni, containing
accounts of the ceremonies of ordination, baptism,
administration of the sacrament, etc., and a record of certain
utterances and writings of his father Mormon.</p>


<p class="center">THE GENUINENESS OF THE BOOK OF MORMON.</p>

<p><b>26.</b> The earnest student of the Book of Mormon will be
most concerned in his consideration of the reliability of the
great record; and this subject may be conveniently considered
under two headings: 1st, the genuineness and integrity
of the Book of Mormon, i. e., the evidence that the
book is what it professes to be,&mdash;an actual translation of
ancient records; 2nd, the authenticity of the original writings,
as shown by internal and external evidence.</p>

<p><b>27. The Genuineness of the Book</b> will appear to anyone
who undertakes an impartial investigation into the circumstances
attending its coming forth. The many so-called
theories of its origin, advanced by prejudiced opponents to
the work of God, are in general too inconsistent, and in
most instances too thoroughly puerile, to merit serious consideration.
Such fancies as are set forth in representations
of the Book of Mormon as the production of a single author
or of men working in collusion, as a work of fiction, or in
any manner as a modern composition, are their own refutation.<a name="FNanchor_783_783" id="FNanchor_783_783"></a><a href="#Footnote_783_783" class="fnanchor">[783]</a>
The sacred character of the plates forbade their display
as a means of gratifying personal curiosity; nevertheless
a number of reputable witnesses examined them, and these
men have given to the world their solemn testimony of the
fact. In June, 1829, the prophecies respecting the witnesses
by whose testimony the word of God as set forth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
in the Book of Mormon was to be established,<a name="FNanchor_784_784" id="FNanchor_784_784"></a><a href="#Footnote_784_784" class="fnanchor">[784]</a> saw its
fulfillment in a manifestation of Divine power, demonstrating
the genuineness of the record to three men, whose affirmations
accompany all editions of the book.</p>

<p><b>28. The Testimony of Three Witnesses.</b>&mdash;Be it known
unto all nations, kindreds, tongues, and people unto whom
this work shall come, that we, through the grace of God
the Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ, have seen the plates
which contain this record, which is a record of the people
of Nephi, and also of the Lamanites, their brethren, and
also of the people of Jared, who came from the tower of
which hath been spoken; and we also know that they have
been translated by the gift and power of God, for his voice
hath declared it unto us,<a name="FNanchor_785_785" id="FNanchor_785_785"></a><a href="#Footnote_785_785" class="fnanchor">[785]</a> wherefore we know of a surety
that the work is true. And we also testify that we have
seen the engravings<a name="FNanchor_786_786" id="FNanchor_786_786"></a><a href="#Footnote_786_786" class="fnanchor">[786]</a> which are upon the plates; and they have
been shown unto us by the power of God, and not of man.
And we declare with words of soberness, that an angel of
God came down from heaven<a name="FNanchor_787_787" id="FNanchor_787_787"></a><a href="#Footnote_787_787" class="fnanchor">[787]</a> and he brought and laid before
our eyes, that we beheld and saw the plates, and the
engravings thereon; and we know that it is by the grace of
God the Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ, that we beheld
and bear record that these things are true; and it is marvelous
in our eyes, nevertheless the voice of the Lord commanded
us that we should bear record of it; wherefore, to
be obedient unto the commandments of God, we bear testimony
of these things. And we know that if we are faithful
in Christ, we shall rid our garments of the blood of all
men, and be found spotless before the judgment-seat of
Christ, and shall dwell with him eternally in the heavens.
And the honor be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the
Holy Ghost, which is one God. Amen.</p>

<p><b>29.</b> The testimony so declared was never revoked, nor
even modified by any one of the witnesses whose names are
subscribed to the foregoing,<a name="FNanchor_788_788" id="FNanchor_788_788"></a><a href="#Footnote_788_788" class="fnanchor">[788]</a> though all of them withdrew
from the Church, and developed feelings amounting almost
to hatred toward Joseph Smith. To the last of their lives,
they maintained the same solemn declaration of the angelic
visit, and of the testimony that had been implanted in
their hearts. Shortly after the witnessing of the plates by
the three, other eight persons were permitted to see and
handle the ancient records; and in this also was prophecy
fulfilled, in that it was of old declared, that beside the
three, "God sendeth more witnesses,"<a name="FNanchor_789_789" id="FNanchor_789_789"></a><a href="#Footnote_789_789" class="fnanchor">[789]</a> whose testimony
would be added to that of the three. It was presumably in
July, 1829, that Joseph Smith showed the plates to the
eight whose names are attached to the following certificate.</p>

<p><b>30. The Testimony of Eight Witnesses.</b>&mdash;Be it known
unto all nations, kindreds, tongues, and people unto whom
this work shall come, that Joseph Smith, Jun., the translator
of this work, has shown unto us the plates of which
hath been spoken, which have the appearance of gold; and
as many of the leaves as the said Smith has translated, we
did handle with our hands; and we also saw the engravings
thereon, all of which has the appearance of ancient work,
and of curious workmanship. And this we bear record with
words of soberness, that the said Smith has shown unto us,
for we have seen and hefted, and know of a surety that the
said Smith has got the plates of which we have spoken.
And we give our names unto the world, to witness unto the
world that which we have seen; and we lie not, God bearing
witness of it.</p>

<h3>NOTES.</h3>

<blockquote>

<p><b>1. Book of Mormon Title Page.</b>&mdash;"I wish to mention here that the title page
of the Book of Mormon is a literal translation, taken from the very last leaf on the left
hand side of the collection or book of plates, which contained the record which has been
translated, the language of the whole running the same as all Hebrew writing in general;
and that said title page is not by any means a modern composition, either of mine or any
other man who has lived or does live in this generation."&mdash;<cite>Joseph Smith</cite>, "Ch.
Hist.," Vol. I, p. 71.</p>

<p><b>2. Theories concerning the Origin of the Book of Mormon. The
Spaulding Story.</b>&mdash;The true account of the origin of the Book of Mormon was rejected
by the public in general, who thus assumed the responsibility of explaining in some
plausible way the source of the record. Many vague theories, based on the incredible
assumption that the book was the work of a single author, were put forward; of these
the most famous, and, indeed, the only one that lived long enough in public favor to be
discussed, is the so called "Spaulding Story." Solomon Spaulding, a clergyman of
Amity, Pa., wrote a romance to which no title other than "Manuscript Story" was prefixed.
Twenty years after the author's death, one Hurlburt, an apostate from the Church
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, announced a resemblance between the story and the
Book of Mormon, and expressed his conviction that the work presented to the world by
Joseph Smith was nothing but Spaulding's romance revised and amplified. The manuscript
was lost for a time, and, in the absence of proof to the contrary, stories of the
parallelism between the two works multiplied. But, by a fortunate circumstance, in
1884 President James H. Fairchild of Oberlin College, Ohio, and a literary friend, one
Mr. Rice, in examining a heterogeneous collection of old papers that had been purchased
by Mr. Rice, found the original story. The gentlemen made a careful comparison of the
manuscript and the Book of Mormon; and, with the sole desire of subserving the purposes
of truth, made public their results. Pres. Fairchild published an article in the
<cite>New York Observer</cite>, Feb. 5, 1885, in which he said:&mdash;"The theory of the origin of the
Book of Mormon in the traditional manuscript of Solomon Spaulding will probably have
to be relinquished.... Mr. Rice, myself, and others compared it [the Spaulding
manuscript] with the Book of Mormon and could detect no resemblance between the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
two.... Some other explanation of the Book of Mormon must be found, if any
explanation is required."</p>

<p>The manuscript was deposited in the library of Oberlin College, where it now reposes.
Still, the theory of the "Manuscript Found," as Spaulding's story has come to be known,
is occasionally pressed into service in the cause of anti-"Mormon" zeal, by some whom
we will charitably believe to be ignorant of the facts set forth by Pres. Fairchild. A
letter of more recent date, written by that honorable gentleman in reply to an enquiring
correspondent, was published in the <cite>Millennial Star</cite>, Liverpool, Nov. 3, 1898, and is as
follows:</p>

<p><em>J. R. Hindley, Esq.</em>,</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>:&mdash;We have in our College Library an original manuscript of Solomon
Spaulding&mdash;unquestionably genuine.</p>

<p>I found it in 1884 in the hands of Hon. L. L. Rice of Honolulu, Hawaiian Islands.
He was formerly State Printer at Columbus, O., and before that, publisher of a paper in
Painesville, whose preceding publisher had visited Mrs. Spaulding and obtained the
manuscript from her. It had lain among his old papers forty years or more, and was
brought out by my asking him to look up anti-slavery documents among his papers.</p>

<p>The manuscript has upon it the signatures of several men of Conneaut, O., who had
heard Spaulding read it and knew it to be his. No one can see it and question its genuineness.
The manuscript has been printed twice at least&mdash;once by the Mormons of Salt
Lake City, and once by the Josephite Mormons of Iowa. The Utah Mormons obtained
the copy of Mr. Rice at Honolulu, and the Josephites got it of me after it came into my
possession.</p>

<p><b>5. Consistency of the Book of Mormon.</b>&mdash;"If the historical parts of the
Book of Mormon be compared with what little is known from other sources, concerning
the history of ancient America, there will be found much evidence to substantiate its
truth; but there cannot be found one truth among all the gleanings of antiquity that
clashes with the historical truths of the Book of Mormon. If the prophetical part of this
wonderful book be compared with the prophetical declarations of the Bible, there will be
found much evidence in the latter to establish the truth of the former. But though there
are many predictions in the Book of Mormon, relating to the great events of the last days,
which the Bible gives us no information about, yet there is nothing in the predictions of
the Bible that contradicts in the least the predictions of the Book of Mormon. If the
doctrinal part of the Book of Mormon be compared with the doctrines of the Bible, there
will be found the same perfect harmony which we find on the comparison of the prophetical
parts of the two books. Although there are many points of the doctrine of
Christ that are far more plain and definite in the Book of Mormon than in the Bible, and
many things revealed in relation to doctrine that never could be fully learned from the
Bible, yet there are not any items of doctrine in the two sacred books that contradict each
other or clash in the least. If the various books which enter into the collection called
the Book of Mormon be carefully compared with each other, there will be found nothing
contradictory in history, in prophecy, or in doctrine.... If we compare the historical,
prophetical, and doctrinal parts of the Book of Mormon with the great truths of
science and nature, we find no contradictions&mdash;no absurdities&mdash;nothing unreasonable.
The most perfect harmony therefore exists between the great truths revealed in the Book
of Mormon and all other known truths, whether religious, historical, or scientific."&mdash;Apostle
Orson Pratt in <cite>Divine Authenticity of the Book of Mormon</cite>, p. 56.</p></blockquote>

<p class="center">AUTHENTICITY OF THE BOOK OF MORMON.</p>

<p><b>1. The Divine Authenticity of the Book of Mormon</b> constitutes
our most important consideration of the work. This
subject is one of vital interest to every earnest investigator
of the ways of God, to every sincere searcher after truth.
Claiming to be, as far as the present dispensation is concerned,
a new scripture, presenting prophecies and revelations
not heretofore recognized in modern theology, announcing
to the world the message of a departed people,
written by way of commandment, and by the spirit of
prophecy and revelation&mdash;this volume is entitled to the most
thorough and impartial examination. Nay, more, not alone
does the Book of Mormon merit such consideration, it
claims, even demands the same; for surely no one professing
the most cursory belief in the power and authority of God
can receive with unconcern the announcement of a new
revelation, having the seal of Divine authority upon it.
The question of the authenticity of the Book of Mormon is
therefore one in which the world is interested.</p>

<p><b>2.</b> The Latter-day Saints base their belief in the authenticity
and genuineness of the book on the following proofs:&mdash;</p>

<p>I. The general agreement of the Book of Mormon with
the Bible.</p>

<p>II. The fulfillment of ancient prophecies accomplished
by the bringing forth of the Book of Mormon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span></p>

<p>III. The strict agreement and consistency of the Book
of Mormon with itself.</p>

<p>IV. The evident truth of its contained prophecies.</p>

<p>To these may be added certain external, or extra-scriptural
evidences, amongst which are:&mdash;</p>


<p>V. The strongly corroborative evidence furnished by
modern discoveries in the field of archeological and ethnological
science.</p>


<p class="center">I. THE BOOK OF MORMON AND THE BIBLE.</p>

<p><b>3. The Nephite and the Jewish Scriptures</b> are found to
agree in all matters of tradition, history, doctrine, and
prophecy upon which both the separate records treat. These
two volumes of scripture were prepared on opposite hemispheres,
under conditions and circumstances widely diverse;
yet between them there exists a surprising harmony, confirmatory
of Divine inspiration in both. The Book of
Mormon contains a number of quotations from the ancient
Jewish scriptures, a copy of which, as far as they had been
compiled at the time of Lehi's exodus from Jerusalem, was
brought to the western continent, as part of the record engraved
on the plates of Laban. In the case of such passages,
there is no essential difference between Bible and
Book of Mormon versions, except in instances of probable
error in translation,&mdash;usually apparent through inconsistency
or lack of clearness in the Bible reading. There
are, however, numerous minor variations in corresponding
parts of the two volumes; and between such, examination
usually demonstrates the superior perspicuity of the Nephite
scripture.</p>

<p><b>4.</b> In a careful comparison of the prophecies of the Bible
with corresponding predictions contained in the Book of
Mormon, e. g. those relating to the birth, earthly ministry,
sacrificial death, and second coming of Christ Jesus; with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
others referring to the scattering and subsequent gathering
of Israel; and with such as relate to the establishment of
Zion and the re-building of Jerusalem in the last days, each
of the records will be seen to be corroborative of the other.
True, there are many predictions in one which are not found
in the other; but in no instance has a contradiction or an
inconsistency between the two been pointed out. Between
the doctrinal parts of the two volumes of scripture the same
perfect harmony is found to prevail.</p>

<p><b>5.</b> Of the agreement of the Book of Mormon with the
Bible and with other standards of comparison, Apostle
Orson Pratt has forcefully and truthfully written:&mdash;"If the
miracles of the Book of Mormon be compared with the miracles
of the Bible, there cannot be found in the former anything
that would be more difficult to believe, than what we
find in the latter. If we compare the historical, prophetical,
and doctrinal parts of the Book of Mormon with the great
truths of science and nature, we find no contradictions, no
absurdities, nothing unreasonable. The most perfect harmony,
therefore, exists between the great truths revealed in
the Book of Mormon, and all other known truths, whether
religious, historical, or scientific."<a name="FNanchor_791_791" id="FNanchor_791_791"></a><a href="#Footnote_791_791" class="fnanchor">[791]</a></p>


<p class="center">II. ANCIENT PROPHECY REGARDING THE BOOK OF MORMON.</p>

<p><b>6. Ancient Prophecy</b> has been literally fulfilled in the
coming forth of the Book of Mormon. One of the earliest
prophetic utterances directly bearing upon this subject is
that of Enoch, the ante-diluvian prophet, unto whom the
Lord revealed His purposes for all time. Witnessing in
vision the corruption of mankind, after the ascension of the
Son of Man, Enoch cried unto his God, "Wilt thou not come
again on the earth?" "And the Lord said unto Enoch,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
As I live, even so will I come in the last days....
And the day shall come that the earth shall rest, but before
that day the heavens shall be darkened, and a veil of darkness
shall cover the earth, and the heavens shall shake and
also the earth, and great tribulations shall be among the
children of men; but my people will I preserve, and righteousness
will I send down out of heaven, and truth will I
send forth out of the earth, to bear testimony of Mine Only
Begotten.... and righteousness and truth will I
cause to sweep the earth as with a flood to gather out mine
own elect from the four quarters of the earth, unto a place
which I shall prepare."<a name="FNanchor_792_792" id="FNanchor_792_792"></a><a href="#Footnote_792_792" class="fnanchor">[792]</a> The Latter-day Saints regard
the coming forth of the Book of Mormon, together with the
restoration of the Priesthood by the direct ministration of
heavenly messengers, as a fulfillment of this prophecy, and
of similar predictions contained in the Bible.</p>

<p><b>7. Biblical Prophecies and their Fulfillment.</b>&mdash;David, who
sang his psalms over a thousand years before the "Meridian
of Time," declared, "Truth shall spring out of the earth,
and righteousness shall look down from heaven."<a name="FNanchor_793_793" id="FNanchor_793_793"></a><a href="#Footnote_793_793" class="fnanchor">[793]</a> And so
also declared Isaiah.<a name="FNanchor_794_794" id="FNanchor_794_794"></a><a href="#Footnote_794_794" class="fnanchor">[794]</a> Ezekiel saw in vision<a name="FNanchor_795_795" id="FNanchor_795_795"></a><a href="#Footnote_795_795" class="fnanchor">[795]</a> the coming
together of the stick of Judah, and the stick of Joseph,
signifying, as the Latter-day Saints affirm, the Bible and
the Book of Mormon. The passage last referred to reads,
in the words of Ezekiel:&mdash;"The word of the Lord came
again unto me, saying, Moreover, thou son of man, take thee
one stick, and write upon it, For Judah, and for the children
of Israel his companions: then take another stick, and write
upon it, For Joseph, the stick of Ephraim, and for all the
house of Israel his companions; And join them one to another
into one stick; and they shall become one in thine hand."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span></p>

<p><b>8.</b> When we call to mind the ancient custom in the making
of books,&mdash;that of writing on long strips of parchment
and rolling the same on rods or sticks, the use of the word
"stick" as equivalent to "book" in the passage becomes at
once apparent,<a name="FNanchor_796_796" id="FNanchor_796_796"></a><a href="#Footnote_796_796" class="fnanchor">[796]</a> At the time of this utterance, the Israelites
had divided into two nations known as the people of
Judah, and that of Israel, or Ephraim. There would seem
to be little room for doubt that the records of Judah and of
Joseph are here referred to.<a name="FNanchor_797_797" id="FNanchor_797_797"></a><a href="#Footnote_797_797" class="fnanchor">[797]</a> Now, as we have seen, the
Nephite nation comprised the descendants of Lehi of the
tribe of Manasseh, of Ishmael an Ephraimite, and of Zoram
whose tribal relation is not definitely stated. The Nephites
were then of the tribes of Joseph; and their record or
"stick" is as truly represented by the Book of Mormon as
is the "stick" of Judah by the Bible.</p>

<p><b>9.</b> That the coming forth of the record of Joseph or
Ephraim is to be accomplished through the direct power of
God is evident from the Lord's interpretation of the vision
of Ezekiel, wherein He says:&mdash;"Behold, <em>I will take</em> the stick
of Joseph ... and will put them with him, even with
the stick of Judah."<a name="FNanchor_798_798" id="FNanchor_798_798"></a><a href="#Footnote_798_798" class="fnanchor">[798]</a> And that this union of the two records
is to be a characteristic of the latter days is evident from the
prediction of an event which is to follow immediately, viz.,
the gathering of the tribes from the nations among which
they had been dispersed.<a name="FNanchor_799_799" id="FNanchor_799_799"></a><a href="#Footnote_799_799" class="fnanchor">[799]</a> Comparison with other prophecies
relating to the gathering will conclusively prove that the
great event is to take place in the latter times, preparatory
to the second coming of Christ.<a name="FNanchor_800_800" id="FNanchor_800_800"></a><a href="#Footnote_800_800" class="fnanchor">[800]</a></p>

<p><b>10.</b> Reverting to the writings of Isaiah, we find that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
prophet voicing the Lord's threatenings against Ariel, or
Jerusalem, "the city where David dwelt." Ariel was to be
distressed, burdened with heaviness and sorrow; then the
prophet refers to some people, other than Judah, who occupied
Jerusalem, for he makes comparison with the latter, saying
"And it shall be unto me <em>as</em> Ariel." As to the fate decreed
against this other people we read:&mdash;"And thou shalt be
brought down, and shalt speak out of the ground, and thy
speech shall be low out of the dust, and thy voice shall be,
as of one that hath a familiar spirit, out of the ground, and
thy speech shall whisper out of the dust."<a name="FNanchor_801_801" id="FNanchor_801_801"></a><a href="#Footnote_801_801" class="fnanchor">[801]</a></p>

<p><b>11.</b> Of the fulfillment of these and associated prophecies,
a modern apostle has written:&mdash;"These predictions of Isaiah
could not refer to Ariel, or Jerusalem, because their speech
has not been 'out of the ground,' or 'low out of the dust';
but it refers to the remnant of Joseph who were destroyed
in America upwards of fourteen hundred years ago. The
Book of Mormon describes their downfall, and truly it was
great and terrible. At the crucifixion of Christ, 'the multitude
of their terrible ones,' as Isaiah predicted, 'became as
chaff that passeth away,' and it took place as he further
predicts, 'at an instant suddenly.'... This remnant
of Joseph in their distress and destruction became <em>as</em> Ariel.
As the Roman army lay siege to Ariel, and brought upon
her great distress and sorrow, so did the contending nations
of ancient America bring upon each other the most direful
scenes of blood and carnage. Therefore the Lord
could, with the greatest propriety, when speaking in reference
to this event, declare that, 'It shall be unto me <em>as</em>
Ariel.'"<a name="FNanchor_802_802" id="FNanchor_802_802"></a><a href="#Footnote_802_802" class="fnanchor">[802]</a></p>

<p><b>12.</b> Isaiah's striking prediction that the nation thus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
brought down should "speak out of the ground," with
speech "low out of the dust" was literally fulfilled in the
bringing forth of the Book of Mormon, the original of which
was taken out of the ground, and the voice of the record is
as that of one speaking from the dust. In continuation of
the same prophecy we read:&mdash;"And the vision of all is become
unto you as the words of a book that is sealed, which
men deliver unto one that is learned, saying, Read this, I
pray thee: and he saith, I cannot; for it is sealed: And
the book is delivered unto him that is not learned, saying,
Read this, I pray thee: and he saith, I am not learned."<a name="FNanchor_803_803" id="FNanchor_803_803"></a><a href="#Footnote_803_803" class="fnanchor">[803]</a>
The fulfillment of this prediction is claimed in the presentation
of the transcript from the plates,&mdash;"the words of a
book," not the book itself, to the learned Prof. Anthon,
whose reply almost in the words of the text has been
cited;<a name="FNanchor_804_804" id="FNanchor_804_804"></a><a href="#Footnote_804_804" class="fnanchor">[804]</a> and in the delivery of the book itself to the unfettered
lad, Joseph Smith.</p>


<p class="center">III. CONSISTENCY OF STYLE AND MATTER IN THE BOOK
OF MORMON.</p>

<p><b>13. The Consistency of the Book of Mormon</b> sustains belief
in its Divine origin. The parts bear evidence of having
been written at different times, and under widely varying
conditions. The style of the component books is in harmony
with the times and circumstances of their production.
The portions which were transcribed from the plates bearing
Mormon's abridgment contain numerous interpolations as
comments and explanations of the transcriber; but in the
first six books, which, as already explained, are the verbatim
record of the smaller plates of Nephi, no such interpolations
occur. The book maintains strict consistency throughout<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
all its parts; no contradictions, no disagreements have
been pointed out.</p>

<p><b>14. A Marked Diversity of Style</b> characterizes the several
parts.<a name="FNanchor_805_805" id="FNanchor_805_805"></a><a href="#Footnote_805_805" class="fnanchor">[805]</a> From what has been said regarding the classes of
plates which constitute the original records of the Book of
Mormon, it is evident that the volume contains the compiled
writings of a long line of inspired scribes extending
through a thousand years, this time-range being exclusive of
the earlier years of Jaredite history. Unity of style is not
to be expected under such conditions; and, indeed, did such
occur, it would be fatal to the claims made for the volume.</p>


<p class="center">IV. THE BOOK OF MORMON SUSTAINED BY THE FULFILLMENT
OF ITS CONTAINED PROPHECIES.</p>

<p><b>15. Book of Mormon Predictions</b> are numerous and important.
Amongst the most conclusive proofs of the authenticity
of the book is that furnished by the demonstrated
truth of its contained prophecies. Prophecy is best proved
in the light of its own fulfillment. The predictions contained
within the Book of Mormon may be classed as (<em>a</em>)
Prophecies relating to the time covered by the book itself,
the fulfillment of which is recorded therein; and (<em>b</em>) Prophecies
relating to times beyond the limits of the history
chronicled in the book.</p>

<p><b>16.</b> <em>Prophecies of the First Class</em> named, the fulfillment
of which is attested by the Book of Mormon record, are of
but minor value as proof of the authenticity of the work;
for, had the book been written according to a plot devised
by man, both prediction and fulfillment would have been
provided for with equal care and ingenuity. Nevertheless,
to the studious and conscientious reader, the genuineness
of the book will be apparent; and the account of the
literal realization of the numerous and varied predictions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
relating to the fate then future of the people whose history
is given in the record, as also of those concerning the details
of the birth and death of the Savior, and of His appearing
in a resurrected state, must, by their accuracy and
consistency, appeal with force as evidence of inspiration and
authority in the record.</p>

<p><b>17.</b> <em>Prophecies of the Second Class</em>, relating to a time
which to the writers was far future, are numerous and explicit:
many of them have special reference to the last days,&mdash;the
dispensation of the fulness of times,&mdash;and of these,
some have been already literally accomplished, others are
now in process of actual realization, while yet others are
awaiting fulfillment under specified conditions which seem
now to be rapidly approaching. Among the most remarkable
of the Book of Mormon predictions incident to the last
dispensation are those that relate to its own coming forth
and the effect of its publication amongst mankind. Ezekiel's
biblical prophecy concerning the coming together of the
"sticks," or records, of Judah and of Ephraim has received
attention. Consider the promise made to Joseph who was sold
into Egypt, repeated by Lehi to his son Joseph&mdash;a prediction
which couples the prophecy concerning the book with that of
the seer through whose instrumentality the miracle was to be
accomplished:&mdash;"But a seer will I raise up out of the fruit
of thy loins; and unto him will I give power to bring forth
my word unto the seed of thy loins; and not to the bringing
forth my word only, saith the Lord, but to the convincing
them of my word, which shall have already gone forth
among them. Wherefore, the fruit of thy loins shall write;
and the fruit of the loins of Judah shall write; and that
which shall be written by the fruit of thy loins, and also
that which shall be written by the fruit of the loins of
Judah, shall grow together, unto the confounding of false
doctrines, and laying down of contentions, and establishing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
peace among the fruit of thy loins, and bringing them to
the knowledge of their fathers in the latter days; and also
to the knowledge of my covenants, saith the Lord. And out
of weakness he shall be made strong, in that day when my
work shall commence among all my people, unto the restoring
thee, O house of Israel, saith the Lord."<a name="FNanchor_806_806" id="FNanchor_806_806"></a><a href="#Footnote_806_806" class="fnanchor">[806]</a> The literal
fulfillment of these utterances in the bringing forth of the
Book of Mormon through Joseph Smith is of itself apparent.</p>

<p><b>18.</b> Unto Nephi the Lord showed the effect of the new
publication, declaring that in the day of Israel's gathering,&mdash;plainly
then the day of the fulness of times, as attested
by the Jewish scriptures,&mdash;the words of the Nephites should
be given to the world, and should "hiss forth unto the ends
of the earth, for a standard" unto the house of Israel; and
that then the Gentiles, forgetting even their debt to the
Jews from whom they have received the Bible in which they
profess such faith, would revile and curse that branch of the
covenant people, and would reject the new scripture, exclaiming,
"A Bible! a Bible! we have got a Bible, and there
cannot be any more Bible."<a name="FNanchor_807_807" id="FNanchor_807_807"></a><a href="#Footnote_807_807" class="fnanchor">[807]</a> Is this not the burden of the
frenzied objections raised by the Gentile world against the
Book of Mormon,&mdash;that it is of necessity void because new
revelation is not to be expected?</p>

<p><b>19.</b> Now, in olden times, two witnesses were required to
establish the truth of any allegation; and, says the Lord
concerning the dual records witnessing of Himself:&mdash;"Wherefore
murmur ye, because that ye shall receive more of my
word? Know ye not that the testimony of two nations is a
witness unto you that I am God, that I remember one nation
like unto another? Wherefore, I speak the same words unto
one nation like unto another. And when the two nations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
shall run together, the testimony of the two nations shall
run together also."<a name="FNanchor_808_808" id="FNanchor_808_808"></a><a href="#Footnote_808_808" class="fnanchor">[808]</a></p>

<p><b>20.</b> Associated with these predictions of the joint testimony
of Jewish and Nephite scriptures is another prophecy,
the consummation of which is now eagerly awaited by the
faithful. Other scriptures are promised; note this word
of God:&mdash;"Wherefore, because that ye have a Bible, ye
need not suppose that it contains all my words; neither
need ye suppose that I have not caused more to be written:
... For behold, I shall speak unto the Jews, and they
shall write it; and I shall also speak unto the Nephites, and
they shall write it; and I shall also speak unto the other
tribes of the house of Israel, which I have led away, and
they shall write it; and I shall also speak unto all nations
of the earth, and they shall write it. And it shall come to
pass that the Jews shall have the words of the Nephites, and
the Nephites shall have the words of the Jews; and the
Nephites and the Jews shall have the words of the lost
tribes of Israel; and the lost tribes of Israel shall have the
words of the Nephites and the Jews."<a name="FNanchor_809_809" id="FNanchor_809_809"></a><a href="#Footnote_809_809" class="fnanchor">[809]</a></p>


<p class="center">V. CORROBORATIVE EVIDENCE FURNISHED BY MODERN
DISCOVERIES.</p>

<p><b>21. The Archeology and Ethnology</b> of the western continent
contribute valuable corroborative evidence in support
of the Book of Mormon. These sciences are confessedly
unable to explain in any decisive manner the origin of the
native American races; nevertheless, investigation in this
field has yielded some results that are fairly definite, and
with the most important of these the Book of Mormon
account is in general accord. Among the most prominent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
of the discoveries respecting the aboriginal inhabitants, are
the following:&mdash;</p>

<p>I. That America was inhabited in very ancient times,
probably soon after the building of the Tower of Babel.</p>

<p>II. That the continent has been successively occupied
by different peoples, at least by two classes, or so-called
"races" at widely separated periods.</p>

<p>III. That the aboriginal inhabitants came from the east,
probably from Asia, and that the later occupants, or those
of the second period, were closely allied to, if not identical
with, the Israelites.</p>

<p>IV. That the existing native races of America have
sprung from a common stock.</p>

<p><b>22.</b> From the outline already given of the historical part
of the Book of Mormon, it is seen that each of these discoveries
is fully attested by that record. Thus it is stated
therein:&mdash;</p>

<p>I. That America was settled by the Jaredites, who
came direct from the scenes of Babel.</p>

<p>II. That the Jaredites occupied the land for about
eighteen hundred and fifty years, during which time they
spread over a great part of North and South America;
and that at about the time of their extinction (near 590
B. C.), Lehi and his company came to this continent, where
they developed into the segregated nations Nephites and
Lamanites, the former becoming extinct near 385 A. D.,
about a thousand years after Lehi's arrival on these shores;
the latter continuing in a degenerate condition until the
present, being represented by the Indian tribes of to-day.</p>

<p>III. That Lehi, Ishmael, and Zoram, the progenitors
of both Nephites and Lamanites, were undoubtedly Israelites,
Lehi being of the tribe of Manasseh while Ishmael was
an Ephraimite, and that the colony came direct from Jerusalem,
in Asia.</p>

<p>IV. That the existing Indian tribes are all direct descendants<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
of Lehi and his company, and that therefore they
have sprung from men all of whom were of the house of
Israel.</p>

<p>Now let us examine some of the evidence bearing on
these points presented by individual investigators, most of
whom knew nothing of the Book of Mormon, and none of
whom accept the book as authentic.<a name="FNanchor_810_810" id="FNanchor_810_810"></a><a href="#Footnote_810_810" class="fnanchor">[810]</a></p>

<p><b>23. I. Concerning the very Ancient Period at which
America was Inhabited.</b>&mdash;A recognized authority on American
antiquities gives the following evidence and inference:&mdash;"One
of the arts known to the builders of Babel was that
of brick making. This art was also known to the people who
built the works in the west. The knowledge of copper was
known to the people of the plains of Shinar; for Noah must
have communicated it, as he lived a hundred and fifty <a name="FNanchor_350_350" id="FNanchor_350_350"></a><a href="#Footnote_350_350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a>
years among them after the flood. Also copper was known
to the ante-diluvians. Copper was also known to the authors
of the western monuments. Iron was known to the
ante-diluvians. It was also known to the ancients of the
west. However, it is evident that very little iron was among
them, as very few instances of its discovery in their works
have occurred; and for this very reason we draw a conclusion
that they came to this country soon after the dispersion."<a name="FNanchor_811_811" id="FNanchor_811_811"></a><a href="#Footnote_811_811" class="fnanchor">[811]</a></p>

<p><b>24.</b> Lowry, in his "Reply to official inquiries respecting
the Aborigines of America," concludes concerning the
peopling of the western continent, "that the first settlement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
was made shortly after the confusion of tongues at the
building of the Tower of Babel."<a name="FNanchor_812_812" id="FNanchor_812_812"></a><a href="#Footnote_812_812" class="fnanchor">[812]</a></p>

<p><b>25.</b> Prof. Waterman of Boston says of the progenitors of
the American Indians:&mdash;"When and whence did they come?
Albert Galatin, one of the profoundest philologists of the
age, concluded that, so far as language afforded any clue,
the time of their arrival could not have been long after the
dispersion of the human family."<a name="FNanchor_813_813" id="FNanchor_813_813"></a><a href="#Footnote_813_813" class="fnanchor">[813]</a></p>

<p><b>26.</b> Pritchard says of America's ancient inhabitants,
that "the era of their existence as a distinct and isolated
race must probably be dated as far back as that time which
separated into nations the inhabitants of the old world, and
gave to each branch of the human family its primitive language
and individuality."<a name="FNanchor_814_814" id="FNanchor_814_814"></a><a href="#Footnote_814_814" class="fnanchor">[814]</a></p>

<p><b>27.</b> A native Mexican author, Ixtilxochitl, "fixes the
date of the first peopling of America about the year 2000
B. C.; this closely accords with that given by the Book of
Mormon, which positively declares that it occurred at the
time of the dispersion, when God in His anger scattered
the people upon the face of the whole earth."<a name="FNanchor_815_815" id="FNanchor_815_815"></a><a href="#Footnote_815_815" class="fnanchor">[815]</a> "Referring

the grandson of that respectable old man who built the
great ark to save himself and family from the deluge, and
one of those who undertook the building of that lofty
edifice, which was to reach up to heaven, went by express
command of the Lord to people that land. They say
also that the first people came from the quarter of the
north, and that when they arrived at Soconusco, they separated,
some going to inhabit the country of Nicaragua, and
others remaining at Chiapas."<a name="FNanchor_818_818" id="FNanchor_818_818"></a><a href="#Footnote_818_818" class="fnanchor">[818]</a></p>

<p><b>29. II. Concerning the Successive Occupation of America
by Different Peoples in Ancient Times.</b>&mdash;It has been declared
by eminent students of American archeology that two distinct
classes, by some designated as separate races, of mankind
inhabited this continent in early times: Prof. F. W.
Putnam<a name="FNanchor_819_819" id="FNanchor_819_819"></a><a href="#Footnote_819_819" class="fnanchor">[819]</a> is even more definite in his assertion that one of
these ancient races spread from the north, the other from
the south. This is in agreement with the Book of Mormon
record, which describes the occupation of the continent by
the Jaredites and the Nephites in turn, the former having
established themselves first in North America, the latter
in South America. H. C. Walsh, in an article entitled
"Copan, a City of the Dead,"<a name="FNanchor_820_820" id="FNanchor_820_820"></a><a href="#Footnote_820_820" class="fnanchor">[820]</a> gives many interesting details
of excavation and other work prosecuted by Gordon
under the auspices of the Peabody expedition; and adds,
"All this points to successive periods of occupation, of
which there are other evidences."<a name="FNanchor_821_821" id="FNanchor_821_821"></a><a href="#Footnote_821_821" class="fnanchor">[821]</a></p>

<p><b>30. III. Concerning the Advent of at least One Division
of the Ancient Americans from the East, probably from Asia;
and their Israelitish Origin.</b>&mdash;Confirmatory evidence of
the belief that the aboriginal Americans sprang from the
peoples of the eastern hemisphere is found in the similarity
of record and tradition on the two continents, regarding the
creation, the deluge, and other great events of history.
Boturini,<a name="FNanchor_822_822" id="FNanchor_822_822"></a><a href="#Footnote_822_822" class="fnanchor">[822]</a> who is quoted by most writers on American archeology
says: "There is no Gentile nation that refers to primitive
events with such certainty as the Indians do. They
give us an account of the creation of the world, of the
deluge,<a name="FNanchor_823_823" id="FNanchor_823_823"></a><a href="#Footnote_823_823" class="fnanchor">[823]</a> of the confusion of languages at the Tower of
Babel, and of all other periods and ages of the world, and
of the long peregrinations which their people had in Asia
representing the specific years by their characters; and in
the seven Conejos (rabbits) they tell us of the great eclipse
that occurred at the death of Christ, our Lord."</p>

aboriginal inhabitants of America being of "Old World
origin," but admits his inability to determine when or
whence they came to this continent.<a name="FNanchor_833_833" id="FNanchor_833_833"></a><a href="#Footnote_833_833" class="fnanchor">[833]</a> Waterman, before
cited, says: "This people could not have been created in
Africa, for its inhabitants were widely dissimilar from those
of America; nor in Europe, which was without a native
people agreeing at all with American races; then to Asia
alone could they look for the origin of the Americans."<a name="FNanchor_834_834" id="FNanchor_834_834"></a><a href="#Footnote_834_834" class="fnanchor">[834]</a></p>

rites of circumcision,<a name="FNanchor_835_835" id="FNanchor_835_835"></a><a href="#Footnote_835_835" class="fnanchor">[835]</a> baptism, and animal sacrifice.<a name="FNanchor_836_836" id="FNanchor_836_836"></a><a href="#Footnote_836_836" class="fnanchor">[836]</a> Herrera,

<p><b>34.</b> But it is not alone in the matter of custom and tradition
relating to pre-Christian times that so marked a resemblance
is found between the peoples of the old and the new
world. Many traditions and some records, telling of the
pre-destined Christ and His atoning death, were current
among the native races of this continent long prior to the
advent of Christian discoverers in recent centuries. Indeed,
when the Spaniards first invaded Mexico, their Catholic
priests found a native knowledge of Christ and the Godhead,
so closely corresponding with the doctrines of orthodox<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
Christianity, that they, in their inability to account for
the same, invented the theory that Satan had planted among
the natives of the country an imitation gospel for the purpose
of deluding the people. A rival theory held that
Thomas, the apostle, had visited the western continent, and
had taught the gospel of Christ.<a name="FNanchor_838_838" id="FNanchor_838_838"></a><a href="#Footnote_838_838" class="fnanchor">[838]</a></p>

<p><b>35.</b> Lord Kingsborough, in his comprehensive and
standard work, refers to a manuscript by Las Casas the
Spanish Bishop of Chiapa, which writing is preserved in
the convent of St. Dominic; in this the Bishop states that a
very accurate knowledge of the Godhead was found to exist
among the natives of Yucatan. One of the bishop's emissaries
wrote that "he had met with a principal lord, who informed
him that they believed in God, who resided in heaven, even
the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. The Father was
named Yeona, the Son Bahab, who was born of a virgin,
named Chibirias, and that the Holy Spirit was
called Euach. Bahab, the Son, they said, was put to death
by Eupuro, who scourged Him, and put on His head a crown
of thorns, and placed Him with His arms stretched upon a
beam of wood; and that, on the third day, He came to life,
and ascended into heaven, where He is with the Father;
that immediately after, the Euach. came as a merchant,
bringing precious merchandise, filling those who would
with gifts and graces, abundant and divine."<a name="FNanchor_839_839" id="FNanchor_839_839"></a><a href="#Footnote_839_839" class="fnanchor">[839]</a></p>

Catholics who accompanied Cortez, to be common among
the natives of Mexico and Central America. In addition
to this sign of a belief in Christ, a ceremony akin to that
of the Lord's Supper was witnessed with astonishment by
the invaders. The Aztec priests were seen to prepare a
cake of flour, mixed with blood, which they consecrated
and distributed among the people, who, as they ate, "showed
signs of humiliation and sorrow, declaring it was the flesh
of Deity."<a name="FNanchor_841_841" id="FNanchor_841_841"></a><a href="#Footnote_841_841" class="fnanchor">[841]</a></p>

<p><b>37.</b> The Mexicans recognize a Deity in Quetzalcoatl,
the traditional account of whose life and death is closely
akin to our history of the Christ, so that, says President
John Taylor, "we can come to no other conclusion than
that Quetzalcoatl and Christ are the same being."<a name="FNanchor_842_842" id="FNanchor_842_842"></a><a href="#Footnote_842_842" class="fnanchor">[842]</a> Lord
Kingsborough speaks of a painting of Quetzalcoatl, "in the
attitude of a person crucified, with the impression of nails
in his hands and feet, but not actually upon the cross."
The same authority further says: "The seventy-third plate
of the Borgian MS. is the most remarkable of all, for Quetzalcoatl
is not only represented there as crucified upon a
cross of Greek form, but his burial and descent into hell
are also depicted in a very curious manner." And again:&mdash;"The
Mexicans believe that Quetzalcoatl took human nature
upon him, partaking of all the infirmities of man, and was
not exempt from sorrow, pain, or death, which he suffered
voluntarily to atone for the sins of man."<a name="FNanchor_843_843" id="FNanchor_843_843"></a><a href="#Footnote_843_843" class="fnanchor">[843]</a></p>

<p><b>38.</b> The source of this knowledge of Christ and the Godhead,
to account for which gave such trouble to the Catholic
invaders and caused them to resort to extreme and unfounded
theory, is plainly apparent to the student of the
Book of Mormon. We learn from that sacred scripture,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
that the progenitors of the native American races, for centuries
prior to the time of Christ's birth, lived in the light
of direct revelation, which, coming to them through their
authorized prophets, showed the purposes of God respecting
the redemption of mankind; and, moreover, that the risen
Redeemer ministered unto them in person, and established
His Church among them with all its essential ordinances.
The people have fallen into a state of spiritual degeneracy;
many of their traditions are sadly distorted, and disfigured
by admixture of superstition and human invention; yet the
origin of their knowledge is plainly authentic.</p>

<p><b>39. IV. Concerning the Common Origin of the Native
Races on this Continent.</b>&mdash;That the many tribes and nations
among the Indians and other "native races" of America
are of common parentage is very generally admitted; the
conclusion is based on the evident close relationship in
their languages, traditions, and customs. "Mr. Lewis H.
Morgan finds evidence that the American aborigines had a
common origin in what he calls 'their system of consanguinity
and affinity.' He says, 'The Indian nations from
the Atlantic to the Rocky Mountains, and from the Arctic
sea to the Gulf of Mexico, with the exception of the
Esquimaux, have the same system. It is elaborate and
complicated in its general form and details; and, while
deviations from uniformity occur in the systems of different
stocks, the radical features are in the main constant. This
identity in the essential characteristics of a system so remarkable
tends to show that it must have been transmitted
with the blood to each stock from a common original
source. It affords the strongest evidence yet obtained of
unity in origin of the Indian nations within the regions
defined.'"<a name="FNanchor_844_844" id="FNanchor_844_844"></a><a href="#Footnote_844_844" class="fnanchor">[844]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span></p>
<p><b>40.</b> Baldwin further quotes Bradford's summary of conclusions
regarding the origin and characteristics of the
ancient Americans, amongst which we read:&mdash;"That they
were all of the same origin, branches of the same race, and
possessed of similar customs and institutions."<a name="FNanchor_845_845" id="FNanchor_845_845"></a><a href="#Footnote_845_845" class="fnanchor">[845]</a> Adair
writes:&mdash;"All the various nations of Indians seem to be of
one descent;" and in support of this conclusion he presents
abundant evidence of similarity of language, habits,
and customs, religious ceremonies, modes of administering
justice, etc.<a name="FNanchor_846_846" id="FNanchor_846_846"></a><a href="#Footnote_846_846" class="fnanchor">[846]</a></p>

<p><b>41. Written Language of the Ancient Americans.</b>&mdash;To
these secular, or extra-scriptural, evidences of the authenticity
of the Book of Mormon may be added the agreement
of the record with recent discoveries regarding the written
language of these ancient peoples. The prophet Nephi
states that he made his record on the plates in "the language
of the Egyptians,"<a name="FNanchor_847_847" id="FNanchor_847_847"></a><a href="#Footnote_847_847" class="fnanchor">[847]</a> and we are further told that the
brazen plates of Laban were inscribed in the same.<a name="FNanchor_848_848" id="FNanchor_848_848"></a><a href="#Footnote_848_848" class="fnanchor">[848]</a> Mormon,
who abridged the voluminous writings of his predecessors,
and prepared the plates from which the modern translation
was made, employed also the Egyptian characters. His son
Moroni, who completed the record, declares this fact; but,
recognizing a difference between the writing of his day and
that on the earlier plates, he attributed the change to the
natural mutation through time, and speaks of his own record
and that of his father, Mormon, as being written in the
"reformed Egyptian."<a name="FNanchor_849_849" id="FNanchor_849_849"></a><a href="#Footnote_849_849" class="fnanchor">[849]</a></p>

<p><b>42.</b> Now consider the testimony of Dr. Le Plongeon,
announcing his discovery of a sacred alphabet among the
Mayas of Central America, which he declares to be practically<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
identical with the Egyptian alphabet. He states that
the structure of the Maya sacred language closely resembles
that of the Egyptians; and he boldly proclaims his conviction
that the two nations derived their written language
from the same source.<a name="FNanchor_850_850" id="FNanchor_850_850"></a><a href="#Footnote_850_850" class="fnanchor">[850]</a> Another authority says:&mdash;"The eye
of the antiquarian cannot fail to be both attracted and fixed
by evidence of the existence of two great branches of the
hieroglyphical language,&mdash;both having striking affinities
with the Egyptian, and yet distinguished from it by characteristics
perfectly American."<a name="FNanchor_851_851" id="FNanchor_851_851"></a><a href="#Footnote_851_851" class="fnanchor">[851]</a></p>

<p><b>43.</b> But the Egyptian is not the only eastern language
found to be represented in the relics of American antiquities;
the Hebrew occurs in this connection with at least
equal significance. That the Hebrew tongue should have
been used by Lehi's descendants is most natural, inasmuch
as they were of the House of Israel, transferred to the
western continent directly from Jerusalem. That the ability
to read and write in that language continued with the
Nephites until the time of their extinction is evident from
Moroni's statement regarding the language used on the
plates of Mormon:&mdash;"And now behold, we have written this
record according to our knowledge, in the characters which
are called among us the reformed Egyptian being handed
down and altered by us according to our manner of speech.
And if our plates had been sufficiently large, we should have
written in Hebrew; but the Hebrew hath been altered by us
also."<a name="FNanchor_852_852" id="FNanchor_852_852"></a><a href="#Footnote_852_852" class="fnanchor">[852]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span></p>
<p><b>44.</b> The following instances are taken from an instructive
array of such, brought together by Elder George Reynolds.<a name="FNanchor_853_853" id="FNanchor_853_853"></a><a href="#Footnote_853_853" class="fnanchor">[853]</a>
Several of the early Spanish writers claim that the natives
of some portions of the land were found speaking a corrupt
Hebrew. "Las Casas so affirms with regard to the inhabitants
of the island of Hayti. Lafitu wrote a history wherein
he maintained that the Caribbee language was radically
Hebrew. Isaac Nasci, a learned Jew of Surinam, says of
the language of the people of Guiana, that all their substantives
are Hebrew." Spanish historians record the early
discovery of Hebrew characters on the western continent.
"Malvenda says that the natives of St. Michael had tombstones,
which the Spaniards digged up, with several ancient
Hebrew inscriptions upon them."</p>

<p><b>45.</b> In all such writings, the characters and the language
are allied to the most ancient form of Hebrew, and show
none of the vowel signs and terminal letters which were introduced
into the Hebrew of the eastern continent after the
return of the Jews from the Babylonian captivity. This is
consistent with the fact that Lehi and his people left Jerusalem
shortly before the captivity, and therefore prior to the
introduction of the changes in the written language.<a name="FNanchor_854_854" id="FNanchor_854_854"></a><a href="#Footnote_854_854" class="fnanchor">[854]</a></p>

<p><b>46. Another Test.</b>&mdash;Let not the reader of the Book of
Mormon content himself with such evidences as have been
cited concerning the Divine authenticity of this reputed
scripture. There is promised a surer and a more effectual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
means of ascertaining the truth or falsity of this marvelous
volume. Like other scriptures, the Book of Mormon is to
be comprehended through the spirit of the scriptures, and
this is obtainable only as a gift from God. But this gift,
priceless though it be, is promised unto all who would seek
for it. Then to all let us commend the counsel of the
last writer in the volume, Moroni, the solitary scribe who
sealed the book, afterward the angel of the record who
brought it forth:&mdash;"And when ye shall receive these
things, I would exhort you that ye would ask God, the
Eternal Father, in the name of Christ, if these things are
not true; and if ye shall ask with a sincere heart, with
real intent, having faith in Christ, he will manifest the
truth of it unto you, by the power of the Holy Ghost; and
by the power of the Holy Ghost ye may know the truth of
all things."<a name="FNanchor_855_855" id="FNanchor_855_855"></a><a href="#Footnote_855_855" class="fnanchor">[855]</a></p>


<h3>NOTES.</h3>

<blockquote>

<p><b>1. Diversity of Literary Style in the Book of Mormon.</b>&mdash;"There is a
marked difference in the literary style of Nephi and some of the other earlier prophets
from that of Mormon and Moroni. Mormon and his son are more direct and take fewer
words to express their ideas than did the earlier writers; at least their manner is, to most
readers, the more pleasing. Amos, the son of Jacob, has also a style peculiar to himself.
There is another noticeable fact that when original records or discourses, such as the
record of Limhi, the sermons of Alma, Amulek, etc., the epistles of Helaman, and
others, are introduced into Mormon's abridgment, words and expressions are used that
appear nowhere else in the Book of Mormon. This diversity of style, expression, and
wording is a very pleasing incidental testimony to the truth of the claim made for the
Book of Mormon,&mdash;that it is a compilation of the work of many writers."&mdash;From Lectures
on the Book of Mormon, by Elder George Reynolds.</p>

<p><b>2. Mexican Date of the Deluge.</b>&mdash;In speaking of the time of the Deluge as
given by the Mexican author, Ixtilxochitl, Elder George Reynolds says:&mdash;"There is a
remarkable agreement between this writer's statements and the Book of Genesis. The
time from the Fall to the Flood only differs sixty, possibly only five years, if the following
statement in the Book of Doctrine and Covenants (cvii, 49) regarding Enoch lengthens
the chronology: "And he saw the Lord, and he walked with him, and was before his
face continually; and he walked with God 365 years, making him 430 years old when he
was translated." The same statement is made in the Pearl of Great Price, Moses vii, 67.&mdash;From<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
lecture on <em>External Evidences of the Book of Mormon</em>, by Elder George
Reynolds.</p>

<p><b>3. Ancient Civilization in America.</b>&mdash;"That a civilization once flourished in
these regions [Central America and Mexico] much higher than any the Spanish conquerors
found upon their arrival, there can be no doubt. By far the most important
work that has been done among the remains of the old Maya civilization has been
carried on by the Peabody Museum of Harvard College, through a series of expeditions
it has sent to the buried city now called Copan, in Spanish Honduras. In a beautiful
valley near the borderland of Guatemala, surrounded by steep mountains and watered
by a winding river, the hoary city lies wrapped in the sleep of ages. The ruins at Copan,
although in a more advanced state of destruction than those of the Maya cities of Yucatan,
have a general similarity to the latter in the design of the buildings, and in the
sculptures, while the characters in the inscriptions are essentially the same. It would
seem, therefore, that Copan was a city of the Mayas; but if so it must have been one of
their most ancient settlements, fallen into decay long before the cities of Yucatan reached
their prime. The Maya civilization was totally distinct from the Aztec or Mexican; it
was an older and also a much higher civilization."&mdash;Henry C. Walsh, in article, <cite>Copan&mdash;a
City of the Dead</cite>, Harper's Weekly, October, 1897.</p>

<p>Baldwin in his valuable work "Ancient America" incorporates the conclusions
announced by Bradford in regard to the ancient occupants of North America, as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"That they were all of the same origin, branches of the same race, and possessed of
similar customs and institutions.</p>

<p>"That they were populous, and occupied a great extent of territory.</p>

<p>"That they had arrived at a considerable degree of civilization, were associated in
large communities, and lived in extensive cities.</p>

<p>"That they possessed the use of many of the metals, such as lead, copper, gold, and
silver, and probably the art of working in them.</p>

<p>"That they sculptured in stone, and sometimes used that material in the construction
of their edifices.</p>

<p>"That they had the knowledge of the arch of receding steps; of the art of pottery,
producing urns and utensils formed with taste, and constructed upon the principles of
chemical composition; and the art of brick-making.</p>

<p>"That they worked the salt springs, and manufactured salt.</p>

<p>"That they were an agricultural people, living under the influence and protection of
regular forms of governments.</p>

<p>"That they possessed a decided system of religion, and a mythology connected with
astronomy, which, with its sister science, geometry, was in the hands of the priesthood.</p>

<p>"That they were skilled in the art of fortification.</p>

<p>"That the epoch of their original settlement in the United States is of great antiquity;
and that the only indications of their origin to be gathered from the locality of their
ruined monuments, point toward Mexico."&mdash;Baldwin, <cite>Ancient America</cite>, p. 56.</p>

<p><b>4. American Traditions concerning the Deluge.</b>&mdash;"Don Francisco
Munoz de la Vega, the Bishop of that diocese (Chiapas), certifies in the prologue to his
'Diocesan Constitutions,' declaring that an ancient manuscript of the primitive Indians
of that province, who had learned the art of writing, was in his record office, who retained
the constant tradition that the father and founder of their nation was named
Teponahuale, which signifies lord of the hollow piece of wood; and that he was present
at the building of the Great Wall, for so they named the Tower of Babel; and beheld
with his own eyes the confusion of language; after which event, God, the Creator, commanded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
him to come to these extensive regions, and to divide them amongst mankind."&mdash;Lord
Kingsborough, <cite>Mexican Antiquities</cite>, vol. viii, p. 25.</p>

<p>"It is found in the histories of the Toltecs that this age and first world, as they call
it, lasted 1,716 years: that men were destroyed by tremendous rains and lightnings from
the sky, and even all the land, without the exception of anything, and the highest mountains,
were covered up and submerged in water fifteen cubits (caxtolmolatli); and here
they added other fables of how men came to multiply from the few who escaped from
this destruction in a 'toptlipetlocali;' that this word nearly signifies a close chest; and
how, after men had multiplied, they erected a very high 'zacuali,' which is to-day a
tower of great height, in order to take refuge in it should the second world (age) be destroyed.
Presently their languages were confused, and, not being able to understand
each other, they went to different parts of the earth."&mdash;The same, vol. ix, p. 321.</p>

<p>"The most important among the American traditions are the Mexican, for they
appear to have been definitely fixed by symbolic and mnemonic paintings before any
contact with Europeans. According to these documents, the Noah of the Mexican cataclysm
was Coxcox, called by certain people Teocipactli or Tezpi. He had saved himself,
together with his wife Xochiquetzal, in a bark, or, according to other traditions, on a
raft made of cypress-wood (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cypressus disticha</i>). Paintings retracing the deluge of Coxcox
have been discovered among the Aztecs, Miztecs, Zapotecs, Tlascaltecs, and Mechoacaneses.
The tradition of the latter is still more strikingly in conformity with the
story as we have it in Genesis, and in Chaldean sources. It tells how Tezpi embarked in
a spacious vessel with his wife, his children, and several animals, and grain, whose preservation
was essential to the subsistence of the human race. When the great god Tezcatlipoca
decreed that the waters should retire, Tezpi sent a vulture from the bark. The
bird, feeding on the carcases with which the earth was laden, did not return. Tezpi sent
out other birds, of which the humming bird only came back, with a leafy branch in its
beak. Then Tezpi, seeing that the country began to vegetate, left his bark on the
mountain of Colhuacan."&mdash;Donnelly's <cite>Atlantis</cite>, p. 99.</p>

<p>The tradition of a Deluge "was the received notion, under some form or other, of the
most civilized people in the Old World, and of the barbarians of the New. The Aztecs
combined with this some particular circumstances of a more arbitrary character, resembling
the accounts of the east. They believed that two persons survived the Deluge, a
man named Coxcox and his wife. Their heads are represented in ancient painting, together
with a boat floating on the waters at the foot of a mountain. A dove is also depicted,
with a hieroglyphical emblem of language in his mouth, which he is distributing
to the children of Coxcox, who were born dumb. The neighboring people of Michoacan,
inhabiting the same high plains of the Andes, had a still further tradition, that the boat
in which Tegpi, their Noah, escaped, was filled with various kinds of animals and birds.
After some time a vulture was sent out from it, but remained feeding on the dead bodies
of the giants which had been left on the earth as the waters subsided. The little humming
bird, <em>huitzitzilin</em>, was then sent forth, and returned with a twig in his mouth.
The coincidence of both these accounts with the Hebrew and Chaldean narratives is
obvious."&mdash;Prescott, <cite>Conquest of Mexico</cite>, pp. 463-64.</p>

<p><b>5. Mexican Tradition concerning the Savior.</b>&mdash;"The story of the life of
the Mexican divinity, Quetzalcoatl, closely resembles that of the Savior; so closely,
indeed, that we can come to no other conclusion than that Quetzalcoatl and Christ are
the same being. But the history of the former has been handed down to us through an
impure Lamanitish source, which has sadly disfigured and perverted the original incidents
and teachings of the Savior's life and ministry. Regarding this god, Humboldt
writes, 'How truly surprising is it to find that the Mexicans, who seem to have been unacquainted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
with the doctrine of the migration of the soul and the Metempsychosis <em>should
have believed in the incarnation of the only Son of the supreme God, Tomacateuctli</em>.
For Mexican mythology, speaking of no other Son of God except Quetzalcoatl, who was
born of Chimelman, the virgin of Tula (without man), by His breath alone, by which
may be signified His word or will, when it was announced to Chimelman, by the celestial
messenger whom He despatched to inform her that she should conceive a son, it must
be presumed this was Quetzalcoatl, who was the only son. Other authors might be
adduced to show that the Mexicans believe that this Quetzalcoatl was both God and
man; that He had, previously to His incarnation, existed from eternity, and that He had
been the Creator both of the world and man; and that He had descended to reform the
world by endurance, and being King of Tula, was crucified for the sins of mankind, etc.,
as is plainly declared in the tradition of Yucatan, and mysteriously represented in the
Mexican paintings.'"&mdash;Pres. John Taylor, <cite>Mediation and Atonement</cite>, p. 201.</p>

<p><b>7. Survival of the Hebrew Language among American Tribes.</b>&mdash;"It
is claimed that such survivals are numerous in the religious songs and ceremonies of
many of the tribes. A number of writers who visited or resided among the tribes of the
northern continent, assert that the words Yehovah, Yah, Ale, and Hallelujah, could be
distinctly heard in these exercises. Laet and Escarbotus assure us that they often heard
the South American Indians repeat the sacred word Hallelujah."&mdash;Elder George Reynolds,
<cite>The Language of the Book of Mormon</cite>.</p>

<p><b>8. "The Origin of the Pre-Columbian Civilization of America."</b>&mdash;Under
this title an instructive article by G. Elliot Smith appeared in <cite>Science</cite>
vol. xliv, pp. 190-195 (August 11, 1916). As to the interest accorded to the
subject, the author says: "In the whole range of ethnological discussion perhaps
no theme has evoked livelier controversies and excited more widespread interest
than the problems involved in the mysteries of the wonderful civilization that
revealed itself to the astonished Spaniards on their first arrival in America.</p>

<p>"During the last century, which can be regarded as covering the whole period
of scientific investigation in anthropology, the opinions of those who have devoted
attention to such inquiries have undergone the strangest fluctuations. If one
delves into the anthropological journals of forty or fifty years ago they will be
found to abound in careful studies on the part of many of the leading ethnologists
of the time, demonstrating, apparently in a convincing and unquestionable manner,
the spread of curious customs or beliefs from the Old World to the New."
The writer decries the fallacy of assuming that similarities in customs and culture
of widely separated peoples can be explained on any other basis than that of a
common origin, and proceeds as follows: "Why then, it will be asked, in the
face of the overwhelming mass of definite and well-authenticated evidence clearly
pointing to the sources in the Old World from which American civilization
sprung, do so many ethnologists refuse to accept the clear and obvious meaning
of the facts and resort to such childish subterfuges as I have mentioned? Putting
aside the influence of Darwin's work, the misunderstanding of which, as Huxley
remarked, 'led shallow persons to talk nonsense in the name of anthropological
science,' the main factor in blinding so many investigators to appreciate the
significance of the data they themselves so laboriously collect results from a
defect incidental to the nature of their researches.... The failure to
recognize the fact, recently demonstrated so convincingly by Dr. Rivers, that
useful arts are often lost is another, and perhaps the chief, difficulty that has
stood in the way of an adequate appreciation of the history of the spread of
civilization." Dr. Smith presents an impressive array of evidence pointing to the
Old World and specifically to Egypt, as the source of many of the customs by
which the American aborigines are distinguished. The article is accompanied
by a map showing probable routes of travel from the Old World to the New,
and two landing places on the west coast, one in Mexico and another near the
boundary common to Peru and Chile, from which places the immigrants spread.</p></blockquote>

veil. An Anglicized form of the Greek term&mdash;<i lang="el" xml:lang="el">Apocalypse</i>&mdash;is
sometimes used to designate the particular Revelation
given to John upon the Isle of Patmos, the record of which
forms the last book of the New Testament as at present
compiled. Divine revelation, as illustrated by numerous
examples in scripture, may consist of disclosures or declarations
concerning the attributes of Deity, or of an expression
of the Divine will regarding the affairs of men.</p>

<p><b>2.</b> The word <em>inspiration</em> is sometimes invested with a
signification almost identical with that of <em>revelation</em>, though
by its origin and early usage it possessed a distinctive meaning.
To inspire is literally to animate with the spirit; a
man is inspired when under the influence of a power other
than his own. Divine inspiration may be regarded as a
lower or less comprehensive manifestation of the heavenly
influence upon man than is shown in revelation. The difference
therefore is rather one of degree than of kind. By
neither of these directing processes does the Lord deprive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
the human subject of agency or individuality;<a name="FNanchor_856_856" id="FNanchor_856_856"></a><a href="#Footnote_856_856" class="fnanchor">[856]</a> as is proved
by the marked peculiarities of style and method characterizing
the several books of holy writ. Yet, in the giving of
revelation, a more direct influence is exercised upon the
human recipient of the God-given message than is the case
under the lesser, though no less truly Divine, effect of
inspiration.</p>

<p><b>3.</b> The directness and plainness with which God may
communicate with man is dependent upon the purity and
general fitness of the person. One may be susceptible to
inspiration in its lower and simpler phases only; another
may be so thoroughly responsive to this power as to be
capable of receiving direct revelation; and this higher influence
again may manifest itself in varying degrees, and
with a greater or lesser shrouding of the Divine personality.
Consider the Lord's words to Aaron and Miriam, who had
been guilty of disrespect toward Moses the chosen revelator:&mdash;"And
the Lord came down in the pillar of the cloud,
and stood in the door of the tabernacle, and called Aaron
and Miriam: and they both came forth. And He said,
Hear now my words: If there be a prophet among you, I
the Lord will make myself known unto him in a vision, and
will speak unto him in a dream. My servant Moses is not
so, who is faithful in all mine house. With him will I
speak mouth to mouth, even apparently, and not in dark
speeches; and the similitude of the Lord shall he behold."<a name="FNanchor_857_857" id="FNanchor_857_857"></a><a href="#Footnote_857_857" class="fnanchor">[857]</a></p>

<p><b>4.</b> We have seen that among the most conclusive proofs
of the existence of a Supreme Being is that afforded by
direct revelation from God Himself; and that some knowledge
of the attributes and personality of God is essential to
any rational exercise of faith in Him. We can but imperfectly
respect an authority whose very existence is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
matter of uncertainty and conjecture with us; therefore, if
we are to implicitly trust and truly love our Creator, we
must know something of Him. Though the veil of mortality,
with all its thick obscurity, may shut the light of the
Divine presence from the sinful heart, that separating curtain
may be drawn aside and the heavenly light may shine
into the righteous soul. By the listening ear, attuned to
the celestial music, the voice of God has been heard, declaring
His personality and will; to the eye that is freed from
the motes and beams of sin, single in its search after truth,
the hand of God has been made visible; within the soul
properly purified by devotion and humility, the mind of God
has been revealed.</p>

<p><b>5. Revelation is God's Means of Communication.</b>&mdash;We have
no record of a period of time during which an authorized
minister of Christ has dwelt on earth, when the Lord did
not make known to that servant the Divine will concerning
the people. As has been shown, no man can take upon
himself, by his own act alone, the honor and dignity of the
ministry. To become an authorized minister of the Gospel,
"a man must be called of God, by prophecy, and by the laying
on of hands, by those who are in authority," and "those
in authority" must have been similarly called. When thus
commissioned, the chosen one speaks by a power greater
than his own, in preaching the gospel and in administering
the ordinances thereof; he may verily become a prophet
unto the people. The Lord has consistently recognized and
honored his servants so appointed. He has magnified their
office in proportion to their own worthiness, making them
living oracles of the Divine will. This has been true of
every dispensation of the work of God.</p>

<p><b>6.</b> It is a privilege of the Holy Priesthood to commune

<p><b>7. Revelation in Ancient Times.</b>&mdash;Unto Adam, the patriarch
of the race, to whom were committed the keys of the
first dispensation, God revealed His will and gave commandments.<a name="FNanchor_863_863" id="FNanchor_863_863"></a><a href="#Footnote_863_863" class="fnanchor">[863]</a>
While living in a state of child-like innocence
prior to the Fall, Adam had direct communication
with the Lord; then, through transgression the man was
driven from Eden; but he took with him some remembrance
of his former happy state, including a personal knowledge
of the existence and attributes of his Creator. While sweating
under the penalty fore-told and fulfilled upon him, tilling
the earth in a struggle for bread, he continued to call
upon the Lord. As Adam and his wife, Eve, prayed and
toiled, "they heard the voice of the Lord from the way
towards the garden of Eden, speaking unto them; and they
saw him not, for they were shut out from his presence; and
he gave unto them commandments."<a name="FNanchor_864_864" id="FNanchor_864_864"></a><a href="#Footnote_864_864" class="fnanchor">[864]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span></p>

<p><b>8.</b> The patriarchs who succeeded Adam were blessed
with the gift of revelation in varying degrees; Enoch, the
seventh in the line of descent, was particularly endowed. We
learn from the Old Testament that Enoch "walked with
God," and that when he had reached the age of 365 years
"he was not, for God took him."<a name="FNanchor_865_865" id="FNanchor_865_865"></a><a href="#Footnote_865_865" class="fnanchor">[865]</a> From the New Testament
we learn something more regarding his ministry;<a name="FNanchor_866_866" id="FNanchor_866_866"></a><a href="#Footnote_866_866" class="fnanchor">[866]</a> and
the Pearl of Great Price gives us a fuller account of the
Lord's dealings with this chosen Seer.<a name="FNanchor_867_867" id="FNanchor_867_867"></a><a href="#Footnote_867_867" class="fnanchor">[867]</a> Unto him were
made known the plan of redemption, and the prospective
history of the race down to the meridian of time, thence to
the millennium and the final judgment. Unto Noah, the
Lord revealed His intentions regarding the impending
deluge; by this prophetic voice the people were warned and
urged to repent; disregarding it and rejecting the message,
they were destroyed in their iniquity. With Abraham,
God's covenant was established; unto him was revealed the
course of the creative events.<a name="FNanchor_868_868" id="FNanchor_868_868"></a><a href="#Footnote_868_868" class="fnanchor">[868]</a> And this covenant was confirmed
unto Isaac and Jacob.</p>

<p><b>9.</b> Through revelation, God commissioned Moses to lead
Israel from bondage. From the burning bush on Horeb,
the Lord declared to the man thus chosen, "I am the God
of thy father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and
the God of Jacob."<a name="FNanchor_869_869" id="FNanchor_869_869"></a><a href="#Footnote_869_869" class="fnanchor">[869]</a> In all the troublous scenes between
Moses and Pharaoh, the Lord continued His communications
unto His servant, who appeared amidst the glory of the
Divine endowment, a veritable God unto the heathen king.<a name="FNanchor_870_870" id="FNanchor_870_870"></a><a href="#Footnote_870_870" class="fnanchor">[870]</a>
And throughout the wearisome forty years' journeying in
the wilderness, the Lord ceased not to honor His chosen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
prophet. So may we trace the line of revelators,&mdash;men who
have stood, each in his time, as the medium between God
and the people, receiving instruction from the source Divine,
and transmitting it to the masses,&mdash;from Moses to Joshua,
and on through the Judges to David and Solomon, thence
to John, who was the immediate fore-runner of the Messiah.</p>

<p><b>10. Christ Himself was a Revelator.</b>&mdash;Notwithstanding
His personal authority, God though He had been and was,
while the Christ lived as a man among men, He declared
His work to be that of One greater than Himself, by whom
He had been sent, and from whom He received instructions.
Note His words:&mdash;"For I have not spoken of myself; but
the Father which sent me, he gave me a commandment,
what I should say, and what I should speak. And I know
that his commandment is life everlasting: whatsoever I
speak therefore, even as the Father said unto me, so I
speak."<a name="FNanchor_871_871" id="FNanchor_871_871"></a><a href="#Footnote_871_871" class="fnanchor">[871]</a> Further: "I can of mine own self do nothing: as
I hear, I judge: and my judgment is just; because I seek
not mine own will, but the will of the Father which hath
sent me."<a name="FNanchor_872_872" id="FNanchor_872_872"></a><a href="#Footnote_872_872" class="fnanchor">[872]</a> And again, "The words that I speak unto you
I speak not of myself: but the Father that dwelleth in me,
he doeth the works.... And as the Father gave me
commandment, even so do I."<a name="FNanchor_873_873" id="FNanchor_873_873"></a><a href="#Footnote_873_873" class="fnanchor">[873]</a></p>

<p><b>11. The Apostles likewise</b>, left to bear the burden of
the Church after the departure of the Master, looked to
heaven for guidance, expected and received the word of revelation
to direct them in their exalted ministry. Paul writing
to the Corinthians said:&mdash;"But God hath revealed them
[divine truths] unto us by his Spirit: for the Spirit searcheth
all things, yea, the deep things of God. For what man
knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of man which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
is in him? even so the things of God knoweth no man, but
the Spirit of God. Now we have received, not the spirit of
the world, but the Spirit which is of God; that we might
know the things that are freely given to us of God."<a name="FNanchor_874_874" id="FNanchor_874_874"></a><a href="#Footnote_874_874" class="fnanchor">[874]</a></p>

<p><b>12.</b> John, also, declares that the book which is known
specifically as the <em>Revelation</em> was not written of his own
wisdom, but that it is:&mdash;"The Revelation of Jesus Christ,
which God gave unto him, to shew unto his servants
things which must shortly come to pass; and he sent and
signified it by his angel unto his servant John."<a name="FNanchor_875_875" id="FNanchor_875_875"></a><a href="#Footnote_875_875" class="fnanchor">[875]</a></p>

<p><b>13. Continual Revelation Necessary.</b>&mdash;The scriptures are
conclusive as to the fact that, from Adam to John the
Revelator, God directed the affairs of His people by personal
communication through chosen servants. As the written
word&mdash;the record of revelation previously given&mdash;grew with
time, that became a law unto the people; but in no period
was that deemed sufficient. While the revelations of the
past have ever been indispensable as guides to the people,
showing forth, as they do, the plan and purpose of God's
dealings under particular conditions, they may not be
universally and directly applicable to the circumstances of
succeeding times. Many of the revealed laws are of general
application to all men in all ages; e.g., the commandments
"Thou shalt not steal," "Thou shalt not kill," "Thou
shalt not bear false witness," and other injunctions regarding
the duty of man toward his fellows, most of which are
so plainly just as to be approved by the human conscience,
even without the direct word of Divine command. Other
laws may be equally general in application, yet they derive
their validity as Divine ordinances from the fact that they
have been authoritatively instituted as such; as examples of
this class, we may consider the requirements concerning the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
sanctity of the Sabbath; the necessity of baptism as a means
of securing forgiveness of sins; the ordinances of confirmation,
the sacrament, etc. Revelations of yet another kind
are on record, such as have been given to meet the conditions
of particular times; these may be regarded as special,
or circumstantial revelations; e.g., the instructions to Noah
regarding the building of the ark and the warning of the
people; the requirement made of Abraham that he leave the
land of his nativity and sojourn in a strange country; the
command to Moses, and through him to Israel, relative to the
exodus from Egypt; the revelations given to Lehi directing
the departure of his company from Jerusalem, their journeying
in the wilderness, the building of a ship, and their
voyage on the great waters to another hemisphere.</p>

<p><b>14.</b> It is at once unreasonable, and directly contrary to
our conception of the unchangeable justice of God, to
believe that He will bless the Church in one dispensation
with a present living revelation of His will, and in another
leave the Church, to which He gives His name, to live as
best it may according to the laws of a by-gone age. True,
through apostasy, the authority of the priesthood may have
been taken from the earth for a season, leaving the people in
a condition of darkness, with the windows of heaven shut
against them; but at such times, God has recognized no
earthly Church as His own, nor any prophet to declare with
authority "Thus saith the Lord."</p>

<p><b>15.</b> In support of the doctrine that revelation specially
adapted to existing conditions is characteristic of God's
dealings with His people, we have the fact of laws having
been ordained and subsequently repealed, when a more
advanced stage of the Divine plan had been reached. Thus,
the law of Moses<a name="FNanchor_876_876" id="FNanchor_876_876"></a><a href="#Footnote_876_876" class="fnanchor">[876]</a> was strictly binding upon Israel from the
time of the exodus to that of Christ's ministry; but its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
repeal was declared by the Savior Himself,<a name="FNanchor_877_877" id="FNanchor_877_877"></a><a href="#Footnote_877_877" class="fnanchor">[877]</a> and a higher
law than that "of carnal commandments," which had been
given "because of transgression," was instituted in its
stead.</p>

<p><b>16.</b> From the scriptures cited, and from numerous other
assurances of holy writ, it is evident that continual revelation
has ever been characteristic of the living Church. It
is equally plain that revelation is essential to the existence
of the Church in an organized state on the earth. If to have
authority to preach the Gospel, and administer in the ordinances
of the same, a man must be called of God, "by
prophecy"<a name="FNanchor_878_878" id="FNanchor_878_878"></a><a href="#Footnote_878_878" class="fnanchor">[878]</a> it is evident that in the absence of direct revelation,
the Church would be left without authorized officers,
and would, in consequence, become extinct. The prophets
and patriarchs of old, the judges, the priests, and every
authorized servant from Adam to Malachi, were called by
direct revelation manifested through the special word of
prophecy. This was true also of John the Baptist,<a name="FNanchor_879_879" id="FNanchor_879_879"></a><a href="#Footnote_879_879" class="fnanchor">[879]</a> of
Christ Himself, and of the apostles,<a name="FNanchor_880_880" id="FNanchor_880_880"></a><a href="#Footnote_880_880" class="fnanchor">[880]</a> and lesser officers<a name="FNanchor_881_881" id="FNanchor_881_881"></a><a href="#Footnote_881_881" class="fnanchor">[881]</a> of
the Church, as long as an organization recognized of God
remained on the earth. Without the gift of continual revelation
there can be no authorized ministry on the earth; and
without officers duly commissioned there can be no Church
of Christ.</p>

<p><b>17.</b> Revelation is essential to the Church, not only for
the proper calling and ordination of its ministers, but also
that the officers so chosen may be guided in their ministrations:&mdash;to
teach with authority the doctrines of salvation;
to admonish, to encourage, and if necessary to reprove the
people; and to declare unto them by prophecy the purposes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
and will of God respecting the Church, present and future.
The promise of salvation is not limited by time, place, or
persons. So taught Peter on Pentecost day, assuring the
multitude of their eligibility to blessing:&mdash;"For the promise
is unto you," said he, "and to your children, and to all
that are afar off, even as many as the Lord our God shall
call."<a name="FNanchor_882_882" id="FNanchor_882_882"></a><a href="#Footnote_882_882" class="fnanchor">[882]</a> Salvation, with all the gifts of God, was of old for
Jew and Greek alike;<a name="FNanchor_883_883" id="FNanchor_883_883"></a><a href="#Footnote_883_883" class="fnanchor">[883]</a> the same Lord over all, rich unto
those that call upon Him, without difference.<a name="FNanchor_884_884" id="FNanchor_884_884"></a><a href="#Footnote_884_884" class="fnanchor">[884]</a></p>

<p><b>18. Alleged Objections in Scripture.</b>&mdash;The opponents of
the doctrine of continual revelation quote, with gross perversion
of meaning, certain scriptural passages to sustain
their heresy; among such scriptures are the following. The
words of John with which he approaches the conclusion of
his book are these:&mdash;"For I testify unto every man that
heareth the words of the prophecy of this book, If any
man shall add unto these things, God shall add unto him
the plagues that are written in this book: And if any man
shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy,
God shall take away his part out of the book of life, and out
of the holy city, and from the things which are written in
this book."<a name="FNanchor_885_885" id="FNanchor_885_885"></a><a href="#Footnote_885_885" class="fnanchor">[885]</a> To apply these sayings to the Bible as it was
afterward compiled is wholly unjustified, for surely John
did not write with a knowledge that his book would be the
concluding section of any such compilation of the scriptures
as we now possess in our Bible. John had reference
to his own words, which, having come to him by revelation,
were sacred; and to alter such, by omission or addition,
would be to modify the words of God. The sin of altering
any other part of the revealed word would be equally great.
Moreover, in this oft-quoted passage, no intimation is given<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
that the Lord may not add to or take from the word therein
revealed; the declaration is that no man shall change the
record and escape the penalty.</p>

<p><b>19.</b> A similar injunction against altering the message of
Divine command was uttered by Moses, over fifteen centuries
before the date of John's writing;<a name="FNanchor_886_886" id="FNanchor_886_886"></a><a href="#Footnote_886_886" class="fnanchor">[886]</a> and with a similarly
restricted application. Another alleged objection to modern
revelation is offered in Paul's words to Timothy, regarding
the holy scriptures "which are able to make thee wise unto
salvation,"<a name="FNanchor_887_887" id="FNanchor_887_887"></a><a href="#Footnote_887_887" class="fnanchor">[887]</a> and which are "profitable for doctrine, for reproof,
for correction, for instruction in righteousness, that
the man of God may be perfect, thoroughly furnished unto
all good works."<a name="FNanchor_888_888" id="FNanchor_888_888"></a><a href="#Footnote_888_888" class="fnanchor">[888]</a> And the remarks of the apostle to the
elders at Ephesus are quoted with the same intent; the passage
reads: "Ye know ... how I kept back nothing
that was profitable unto you, but have shewed you, and have
taught you publicly, and from house to house....
For I have not shunned to declare unto you all the counsel
of God."<a name="FNanchor_889_889" id="FNanchor_889_889"></a><a href="#Footnote_889_889" class="fnanchor">[889]</a> It is argued that if the scriptures known
to Timothy were all-sufficient to make him "wise unto salvation,"
and the man of God "perfect, thoroughly furnished
unto all good works," the same scriptures are sufficient for
all men to the end of time; and that if the doctrines
preached to the Ephesian elders represented "all the counsel
of God," no further counsel is to be expected. In reply,
it is perhaps sufficient to say that the objectors to continued
revelation who defend their unscriptural position by
strained interpretation of such passages, if consistent,
would be compelled to reject all revelation given through
the apostles after the date of Paul's utterances, including
even the Revelation of John.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span></p>

<p><b>20.</b> Equally absurd is the assertion that Christ's dying
exclamation, "It is finished," meant that revelation was at
an end; for we find the same Jesus afterward revealing
Himself, as the resurrected Lord, to His apostles, promising
them further revelation,<a name="FNanchor_890_890" id="FNanchor_890_890"></a><a href="#Footnote_890_890" class="fnanchor">[890]</a> and assuring them that He would
be with them even unto the end.<a name="FNanchor_891_891" id="FNanchor_891_891"></a><a href="#Footnote_891_891" class="fnanchor">[891]</a> And, moreover, were
the words of the Crucified One susceptible of any such
intent, the apostles who taught by revelation as long as they
lived must be classed as impostors.</p>

<p><b>21.</b> To justify the anathema with which the opponents
of modern revelation seek to persecute those who believe in
the continual flow of God's word to His Church, the following
prophecy of Zechariah is quoted:&mdash;"And it shall come
to pass in that day, saith the Lord of hosts, that I will cut
off the names of the idols out of the land, and they shall no
more be remembered: and also I will cause the prophets and
the unclean spirit to pass out of the land. And it shall
come to pass, that when any shall yet prophesy, then his
father and his mother that begat him shall say unto him,
Thou shalt not live; for thou speakest lies in the name of
the Lord: and his father and his mother that begat him shall
thrust him through when he prophesieth. And it shall
come to pass in that day, that the prophets shall be ashamed
every one of his vision, when he hath prophesied."<a name="FNanchor_892_892" id="FNanchor_892_892"></a><a href="#Footnote_892_892" class="fnanchor">[892]</a> The
day here spoken of appears to be yet future, for surely the
"idols" and the "unclean spirits" still have influence; and,
moreover, the fact that the "prophets" here intended are
false ones is shown by Zechariah's associating them with
idols and unclean spirits.</p>

<p><b>22.</b> Such attempts to oppose the doctrine of continued
revelation as have been made on the authority of the foregoing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
scriptures are pitiably futile; they carry their own
refutation, and leave untouched the truth, that belief in
modern revelation is wholly reasonable and strictly scriptural.<a name="FNanchor_893_893" id="FNanchor_893_893"></a><a href="#Footnote_893_893" class="fnanchor">[893]</a></p>

<p><b>23. Modern Revelation.</b>&mdash;In the light of our knowledge
concerning the constancy of revelation as an essential
characteristic of the Church, it is as reasonable to look
for new revelation today as to believe in the existence of
the gift during ancient times. "Where there is no vision
the people perish,"<a name="FNanchor_894_894" id="FNanchor_894_894"></a><a href="#Footnote_894_894" class="fnanchor">[894]</a> was declared of old; and surely it is
proper to include with vision, revelation also, since the
latter gift is often manifested through dreams and visions.
Nevertheless, in spite of abundant and most explicit testimony
of scripture, the so-called Christian sects of the day
are practically a unit in declaring that revelation ceased
with the apostles, or even before their time; that further
communication from the heavens is unnecessary; and that
to expect such is unscriptural. In assuming this position,
the discordant sects of the day are but following the path
that was trodden by unbelievers in earlier times. The
recreant Jews rejected the Savior, because He came to them
with a new revelation. Had they not Moses and the
prophets to guide them? what more could they need? They
openly boasted "We are Moses' disciples," and added "We
know that God spake unto Moses; as for this fellow, we
know not from whence he is."<a name="FNanchor_895_895" id="FNanchor_895_895"></a><a href="#Footnote_895_895" class="fnanchor">[895]</a></p>

<p><b>24.</b> The scriptures, far from predicting a cessation of
revelation in latter times, expressly declare the continuation
of that gift among the people of the Lord. John foresaw
the restoration of the gospel in the last days, through
angelic ministration:&mdash;"And I saw another angel fly in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
midst of heaven, having the everlasting gospel to preach
unto them that dwell on the earth, and to every nation, and
kindred, and tongue, and people."<a name="FNanchor_896_896" id="FNanchor_896_896"></a><a href="#Footnote_896_896" class="fnanchor">[896]</a> He knew further that
the voice of God would be heard in the last days, calling
His people from Babylon to a place of safety:&mdash;"And I
heard another voice from heaven, saying, Come out of her,
my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye
receive not of her plagues."<a name="FNanchor_897_897" id="FNanchor_897_897"></a><a href="#Footnote_897_897" class="fnanchor">[897]</a></p>

<p><b>25.</b> The Book of Mormon is not less explicit in declaring
that direct revelation shall abide as a blessing upon the
Church in the latter days. Note the prediction given
through Ether the Jaredite; the context shows that the time
spoken of is that of the last dispensation:&mdash;"And in that
day, they [the Gentiles] shall exercise faith in me, saith
the Lord, even as the brother of Jared did, that they may
become sanctified in me, then will I manifest unto them the
things which the brother of Jared saw, even to the unfolding
unto them all my revelations, saith Jesus Christ, the Son
of God, the Father of the heavens and of the earth, and all
things that in them are.... But he that believeth
these things which I have spoken, him will I visit with the
manifestations of my Spirit, and he shall know and bear
record."<a name="FNanchor_898_898" id="FNanchor_898_898"></a><a href="#Footnote_898_898" class="fnanchor">[898]</a></p>

<p><b>26.</b> Lehi, instructing his sons, quoted a prophecy of
Joseph the son of Jacob, which is not recorded in the
compilation of books known as the Bible; it has special
reference to the work of Joseph the modern prophet:&mdash;"Yea,
Joseph truly said, Thus saith the Lord unto me: A choice
seer will I raise up out of the fruit of thy loins; and he
shall be esteemed highly among the fruit of thy loins. And
unto him will I give commandment, that he shall do a work<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
for the fruit of thy loins, his brethren, which shall be of great

<p><b>27.</b> Nephi, the son of Lehi, spoke by prophecy of the
last days, in which the Gentiles should receive a testimony
of Christ with many signs and wondrous manifestations:&mdash;"He
manifesteth himself unto all those who
believe in him, by the power of the Holy Ghost; yea, unto
every nation, kindred, tongue, and people, working mighty
miracles, signs, and wonders, among the children of men,
according to their faith. But behold, I prophesy unto you
concerning the last days; concerning the days when the
Lord God shall bring these things forth unto the children of
men."<a name="FNanchor_900_900" id="FNanchor_900_900"></a><a href="#Footnote_900_900" class="fnanchor">[900]</a></p>

<p><b>28.</b> The same prophet, apostrophizing with warning
words the unbelievers of the last days, predicted the coming
forth of additional scriptures:&mdash;"And it shall come to
pass, that the Lord God shall bring forth unto you the
words of a book, and they shall be the words of them which
have slumbered. And behold the book shall be sealed: and
in the book shall be a revelation from God, from the beginning
of the world to the ending thereof."<a name="FNanchor_901_901" id="FNanchor_901_901"></a><a href="#Footnote_901_901" class="fnanchor">[901]</a></p>

<p><b>29.</b> The Savior, addressing the Nephites, repeated the
prediction of Malachi concerning the revelation to be given
through Elijah, before the day of the Lord's second coming:&mdash;"Behold,
I will send you Elijah the prophet before
the coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord; and
he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children, and
the heart of the children to their fathers, lest I come and
smite the earth with a curse."<a name="FNanchor_902_902" id="FNanchor_902_902"></a><a href="#Footnote_902_902" class="fnanchor">[902]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span></p>
<p><b>30.</b> By revelation in the present day, the Lord has confirmed
and fulfilled His early promises, and has specifically
rebuked those who would close His mouth, and estrange
Him from His people. His voice is heard to-day, "proving
to the world that the Holy Scriptures are true, and that
God does inspire men and call them to His holy work in
this age and generation, as well as in generations of old,
thereby showing that He is the same God, yesterday, to-day,
and forever."<a name="FNanchor_903_903" id="FNanchor_903_903"></a><a href="#Footnote_903_903" class="fnanchor">[903]</a></p>

<p><b>31. Revelation Yet Future.</b>&mdash;In view of the demonstrated
facts that revelation between God and man has ever
been and is a characteristic of the Church of Christ, it is
reasonable to await with confident expectation the coming
of other messages from heaven, even until the end of man's
probation on earth. The Church is, and will continue to
be, as truly founded on the rock of revelation as it was in
the day of Christ's prophetic blessing upon Peter, who by
this gift of God was able to testify of his Lord's divinity.<a name="FNanchor_904_904" id="FNanchor_904_904"></a><a href="#Footnote_904_904" class="fnanchor">[904]</a>
Current revelation is equally plain with that of former days,
in predicting the yet future manifestations of God through
this appointed channel.<a name="FNanchor_905_905" id="FNanchor_905_905"></a><a href="#Footnote_905_905" class="fnanchor">[905]</a> The canon of scripture is still
open; many lines, many precepts, are yet to be added;
revelation, surpassing in importance and glorious fulness
any that has been recorded, will yet be given to the Church
and be declared to the world.</p>

<p><b>32.</b> What shadow of justification or pretense of consistency
can man claim for denying the power and purposes
of God to reveal Himself and His will in these days as
He assuredly did in former times? In every department of
human knowledge and activity, in everything for which man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
arrogates to himself glory, he prides himself in the possibilities
of enlargement and growth; yet in the Divine
science of theology, he holds that progress is impossible,
and advancement forbidden. Against such heresy and
blasphemous denial of the Divine prerogatives and power,
God has proclaimed His edict in words of terrible import:&mdash;"Wo
be unto him that shall say We have received the word
of God, and we need no more of the word of God for we
have enough."<a name="FNanchor_906_906" id="FNanchor_906_906"></a><a href="#Footnote_906_906" class="fnanchor">[906]</a> "Deny not the spirit of revelation, nor the

things."<a name="FNanchor_907_907" id="FNanchor_907_907"></a><a href="#Footnote_907_907" class="fnanchor">[907]</a></p>


<h3>NOTES.</h3>

<blockquote>

<p><b>1. Freedom under Inspiration.</b>&mdash;Faussett has this to say of man's agency
under the influence of inspiration:&mdash;"Inspiration does not divest the writers of their
several individualities of style, just as the inspired teachers in the early Church were not
passive machines in prophesying (I Cor. xiv, 32). 'Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there
is liberty' (II Cor. iii, 17). Their will became one with God's will; His Spirit acted on
their spirit, so that their individuality had full play in the sphere of His inspiration. As
to religious truths, the collective Scriptures have unity of authorship; as to other matters,
their authorship is palpably as manifold as the writers. The variety is human, the unity
Divine. If the four evangelists were mere machines, narrating the same events in the
same order and words, they would cease to be independent witnesses. Their very discrepancies
(only <em>seeming</em> ones) disprove collusion.... The slight variations in the
decalogue between Exo. xx and its repetition Deut. v, and in Ps. xviii compared with II
Sam. xxii, in Ps. xiv compared with Ps. liii, and in New Testament quotations of Old
Testament (sometimes from the Septuagint, which varies from the Hebrew, sometimes
from neither in every word), all prove the spirit-produced independence of the sacred
writers, who, under Divine guidance and sanction, presented on different occasions the
same substantial truths under different aspects, the one complementing the other."&mdash;<cite>Bible
Cyclopedia</cite>, A. R. Faussett, p. 308.</p>

<p><b>2. The Doctrine of no Further Revelation, New and False.</b>&mdash;"The
history of the people of God, from the earliest ages, shows that <em>continued revelation</em> was
the only way by which they could possibly learn all their duties, or God's will concerning
them. They never once thought that the revelations given to previous generations
were sufficient to guide them into every duty. A doctrine which rejects new revelation
is a new doctrine, invented by the devil and his agents during the second century after
Christ; it is a doctrine in direct opposition to the one believed in and enjoyed by the
saints in all ages. Now, to subvert and do away a doctrine four thousand years old,
and introduce a new one in its stead can only be done by divine authority.... As<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
the doctrine, then, of continued revelation is one that was always believed by the
saints, it ought not to be required of any man to prove the necessity of the continuation
of such a doctrine. If it were a new doctrine, never before introduced into the world, it
would become necessary to establish its divine origin; but inasmuch as it is only the
continuation of an old doctrine, established thousands of years ago, and which has never
ceased to be believed and enjoyed by the saints, it would be the greatest presumption to
call it in question at this late period; and hence it would seem almost superfluous to
undertake to prove the necessity of its continuance. Instead of being required to do this,
all people have the right to call upon the new-revelation deniers of the last seventeen
centuries to bring forward their strong reasonings and testimonies for breaking in upon
the long-established order of heaven, and introducing a new doctrine so entirely different
from the old. If they wish their new doctrine to be believed, let them demonstrate it to
be of divine origin, or else all people will be justified in rejecting it, and clinging to the
old."&mdash;Orson Pratt, <cite>Divine Authenticity of the Book of Mormon</cite>, I (2) 15, 16.</p>

<p><b>3. Inspiration a Sure Guide.</b>&mdash;"Inspiration has been defined to be the 'actuating
energy of the Holy Spirit, in whatever degree or manner it may have been exercised,
guided by which the human agents chosen by God have officially proclaimed his
will by word of mouth or have committed to writing the several portions of the Bible.'
By <em>plenary inspiration</em> we mean that this energy was so fully and perfectly exercised, as
to make the teaching of the sacred writers to be, in the most literal sense of the words,
God's teaching, as proceeding from him, truly expressing his mind, and bearing with it
the sanction of his authority. By <em>verbal inspiration</em> we mean that this energy was not
exhausted in suggesting to the writers the matter of Scripture, and then leaving them to
themselves to convey, in their own manner and after an exclusively human sort, what
had been supernaturally suggested; but that they were assisted and guided in the conveyance
of the truth received.... When the doctrine of plenary and verbal inspiration
is thus disentangled from the misapprehensions which have been entertained of
it, it presents in no point of view any just ground of objection. It is consistent with all
the conclusions relative to the Word which modern scholarship has succeeded in establishing;
for the dreams of the 'higher criticism' are little more than the vagaries of
arbitrary caprice; and it is much to be regretted that they have been honored with a
deference wholly undeserved, and have been rashly placed side by side with the valuable
and precious results of genuine criticism. These results, in many respects, point decisively
in the direction of plenary inspiration, when the doctrine itself is rightly understood,
as supplying the only consistent and logical ground on which the authority of the
canonical writings can be safely based."&mdash;Cassell's <cite>Bible Dictionary</cite>, pp. 559, 561.</p>

<p><b>4.</b> "Is it unreasonable, is it unphilosophical, thus to look for additional light and
knowledge? Shall religion be the one department of human thought and effort in which
progression is impossible? What would we say of the chemist, the astronomer, the
physicist, or the geologist, who would proclaim that no further discovery or revelation of
scientific truth is possible, or who would declare that the only occupation open to students
of science is to con the books of by-gone times and to apply the principles long ago made
known, for none others shall ever be discovered? The chief motive impelling to research
and investigation is the conviction that to knowledge and wisdom there is no end.
'Mormonism' affirms that all wisdom is of God, that the halo of his glory is intelligence,
and that man has not yet learned all there is to learn of him and his ways. We hold that
the doctrine of continuous revelation from God is not less philosophical and scientific
than scriptural."&mdash;<cite>The Philosophy of "Mormonism.</cite>" The Author, in <cite>Improvement Era</cite>,

<h3>THE DISPERSION OF ISRAEL.</h3>

<blockquote>

<p><b>Article 10.</b>&mdash;We believe in the literal gathering of Israel and in the restoration of
the Ten Tribes, etc.</p></blockquote>


<p><b>1. Israel.</b>&mdash;The term <em>Israel</em>, in its original sense, expressed
the thought of one who had succeeded in his supplication
before the Lord; "soldier of God," "one who contends
with God," "a prince of God," are among the common
English renderings. The name first appears in sacred writ
as a title conferred by the Lord upon Jacob, when the latter
prevailed in his determination to secure a blessing from his
heavenly visitor in the wilderness, receiving the promise
"Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel, for
as a prince hast thou power with God and with men, and
hast prevailed."<a name="FNanchor_908_908" id="FNanchor_908_908"></a><a href="#Footnote_908_908" class="fnanchor">[908]</a> We read further:&mdash;"And God appeared
unto Jacob again, when he came out of Padan-aram, and
blessed him, and God said unto him, Thy name is Jacob;
thy name shall not be called anymore Jacob, but Israel shall
be thy name: and he called his name Israel."<a name="FNanchor_909_909" id="FNanchor_909_909"></a><a href="#Footnote_909_909" class="fnanchor">[909]</a></p>

<p><b>2.</b> But the combined name and title thus bestowed under
conditions of such solemn dignity soon acquired a wider
application, and came in course of time to represent the
entire posterity of Abraham, through Isaac and Jacob,<a name="FNanchor_910_910" id="FNanchor_910_910"></a><a href="#Footnote_910_910" class="fnanchor">[910]</a> with
each of whom the Lord had covenanted, that through his descendants
should all nations of the earth be blessed.<a name="FNanchor_911_911" id="FNanchor_911_911"></a><a href="#Footnote_911_911" class="fnanchor">[911]</a> The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
name of the individual patriarch thus grew into the designation
of a nation, including the twelve tribes; who delighted
in the title Israelites, or children of Israel. By such names
they were collectively known during the dark days of their
Egyptian bondage;<a name="FNanchor_912_912" id="FNanchor_912_912"></a><a href="#Footnote_912_912" class="fnanchor">[912]</a> throughout the four decades of the
exodus and the journey to the land of promise;<a name="FNanchor_913_913" id="FNanchor_913_913"></a><a href="#Footnote_913_913" class="fnanchor">[913]</a> so on
through the period of their existence as a powerful people
under the government of the judges; and as a united nation
during the hundred and twenty years comprised in the
successive reigns of Saul, David, and Solomon.<a name="FNanchor_914_914" id="FNanchor_914_914"></a><a href="#Footnote_914_914" class="fnanchor">[914]</a></p>

<p><b>3.</b> At the death of Solomon, probably about 975 B. C.,
the kingdom was divided; the tribe of Judah and part of
the tribe of Benjamin accepted Rehoboam, the son and
successor of Solomon, as their king; while the rest of the
people, usually spoken of as the ten tribes, revolted against
Rehoboam, thus breaking their allegiance with the house of
David; they chose Jeroboam as their king. The ten tribes
under Jeroboam retained the title <em>Kingdom of Israel</em>, though
the kingdom was likewise known by the name of Ephraim,<a name="FNanchor_915_915" id="FNanchor_915_915"></a><a href="#Footnote_915_915" class="fnanchor">[915]</a>
from its most prominent tribe; while Rehoboam and his subjects
were known as the <em>Kingdom of Judah</em>. For about two
hundred and fifty years the two kingdoms maintained a
separate existence; after which (721 B. C.), the independent
status of the kingdom of Israel was destroyed, and the
people were brought into captivity by the Assyrians under
Shalmanezer. The Kingdom of Judah was recognized for
over a century longer, after which it was brought to an end
by Nebuchadnezzar, who inaugurated the Babylonian captivity.
For about seventy years the people remained in
subjection, which fact was in accordance with the prophecy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
of Jeremiah,<a name="FNanchor_916_916" id="FNanchor_916_916"></a><a href="#Footnote_916_916" class="fnanchor">[916]</a> then the Lord softened the hearts of the ruling
kings, and the work of emancipation was begun by
Cyrus the Persian. The Hebrew people were permitted to
return to Judea, and to rebuild the temple at Jerusalem.</p>

<p><b>4.</b> The people, then commonly known as Hebrews, or
Jews,<a name="FNanchor_917_917" id="FNanchor_917_917"></a><a href="#Footnote_917_917" class="fnanchor">[917]</a> retained as the name of their nation the designation
Israel, though they scarcely comprised two complete tribes
out of the twelve. The name Israel, thus held with commendable
pride by the remnant of a once mighty people,
was used in a figurative manner to designate the chosen and
accepted ones who constituted the Church of Christ;<a name="FNanchor_918_918" id="FNanchor_918_918"></a><a href="#Footnote_918_918" class="fnanchor">[918]</a> and
in that sense it is still employed. The people of Israel, as
first we meet them in history, were a united people. That
we may comprehend the true import of the gathering to
which reference is made in the tenth of the Articles of
Faith, it is necessary that we first consider the dispersions
and scattering to which the people have been subjected.
The scriptures abound in predictions concerning such dispersions;
holy scripture and history in general unite in
testimony of the fulfillment of these prophecies.</p>

<p><b>5. The Dispersion of Israel Foretold.</b>&mdash;It has been said,
that "if a complete history of the house of Israel were
written, it would be the history of histories, the key of the
world's history for the past twenty centuries."<a name="FNanchor_919_919" id="FNanchor_919_919"></a><a href="#Footnote_919_919" class="fnanchor">[919]</a> Justification
for this sweeping statement is found in the fact that
the Israelites have been so completely dispersed among the
nations as to give to this scattered people a place of importance
as a factor in the rise and development of almost
every large division of the human family. This work of
dispersion was brought about by many stages, and extended
through millenniums. It was foreseen by the early<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
prophets among the chosen people; and the spiritual
leaders of every generation prior to and immediately following
the Messianic era predicted the scattering of the people,
as an ordained result of their increasing wickedness, or
referred to the fulfillment of former prophecies regarding
the dispersion, then already accomplished, and foretold a
further and more complete disruption of the nation.</p>

<p><b>6. Biblical Prophecies.</b>&mdash;In the course of Israel's
troubled journey from Egypt, where they had dwelt as in
a "house of bondage," to Canaan, the land of their promised
inheritance, the Lord gave them many laws, and established
ordinances for their government in temporal and spiritual
affairs. He arrayed for their contemplation blessings beyond
the power of the unaided mind of man to conceive,
predicating these upon their obedience to the laws of
righteousness, and their allegiance to Himself as God and
King. In contrast with this picture of blessed prosperity,
the Lord described with terrible distinctness, and soul-harrowing
detail, a state of abject misfortune and blighting
suffering, into which they would surely fall if they departed
from the path of rectitude and adopted the sinful practices
of the heathen peoples with whom they would have dealings.
The darkest parts of this dread picture were those that
depicted the prospective breaking up of the nation, and
the scattering of the people among those who knew not
God. These extreme calamities, however, were to befall
Israel only after less severe chastisements had proved ineffective.<a name="FNanchor_920_920" id="FNanchor_920_920"></a><a href="#Footnote_920_920" class="fnanchor">[920]</a></p>

<p><b>7.</b> When the journey following the exodus was nearing its
close, as the Israelites were preparing to cross the Jordan
and to take possession of the land of promise; when Moses,
patriarch, law-giver, and prophet, was about to ascend
Nebo, from which he was to look over the goodly land and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
then die there; he repeated the story of contrasted blessings
and cursings which formed the condition of God's covenant
with the people. "The Lord shall cause thee to be
smitten before thine enemies"<a name="FNanchor_921_921" id="FNanchor_921_921"></a><a href="#Footnote_921_921" class="fnanchor">[921]</a> was declared unto them; and
again:&mdash;"The Lord shall bring thee, and thy king which thou
shalt set over thee, unto a nation which neither thou nor
thy fathers have known; and there shalt thou serve other
gods, wood and stone. And thou shalt become an astonishment,
a proverb, and a by-word, among all nations
whither the Lord shall lead thee."<a name="FNanchor_922_922" id="FNanchor_922_922"></a><a href="#Footnote_922_922" class="fnanchor">[922]</a> And yet further:&mdash;"The
Lord shall bring a nation against thee from far, from the
end of the earth, as swift as the eagle flieth; a nation whose
tongue thou shalt not understand; a nation of fierce countenance,
which shall not regard the person of the old, nor
shew favor to the young:<a name="FNanchor_923_923" id="FNanchor_923_923"></a><a href="#Footnote_923_923" class="fnanchor">[923]</a> ... And the Lord shall
scatter thee among all people, from the one end of the earth
even unto the other; and there thou shalt serve other gods,
which neither thou nor thy fathers have known, even wood
and stone."<a name="FNanchor_924_924" id="FNanchor_924_924"></a><a href="#Footnote_924_924" class="fnanchor">[924]</a></p>

<p><b>8.</b> As the sacred record progresses, the fact is made plain
that Israel had chosen the evil alternative, forfeiting the
blessings and reaping the curses. When the son of sinful
Jeroboam lay sick almost unto death, the troubled king sent
his wife in disguise to Ahijah, the blind prophet of Israel, to
inquire concerning the fate of the child. The prophet,
seeing beyond the physical blindness of his old age, predicted
the child's death and the overthrow of the house of Jeroboam;
and declared further:&mdash;"For the Lord shall smite
Israel, as a reed is shaken in the water, and he shall root up
Israel out of this good land, which he gave to their fathers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
and shall scatter them beyond the river, because they have
made their groves, provoking the Lord to anger."<a name="FNanchor_925_925" id="FNanchor_925_925"></a><a href="#Footnote_925_925" class="fnanchor">[925]</a></p>

<p><b>9.</b> Through Isaiah the Lord justifies His judgment upon
the people, likening them to an unprofitable vineyard,<a name="FNanchor_926_926" id="FNanchor_926_926"></a><a href="#Footnote_926_926" class="fnanchor">[926]</a> which,
in spite of protecting hedge and fullest care, had yielded
out wild grapes, and which was fit only for spoliation;
"therefore," He continues, "my people have gone into captivity."<a name="FNanchor_927_927" id="FNanchor_927_927"></a><a href="#Footnote_927_927" class="fnanchor">[927]</a>
And yet other tribulations were to follow, against
which the people were warned lest they alienate themselves
entirely from the God of their fathers:&mdash;"And what will ye
do in the day of visitation, and in the desolation which
shall come from far? to whom will ye flee for help?"<a name="FNanchor_928_928" id="FNanchor_928_928"></a><a href="#Footnote_928_928" class="fnanchor">[928]</a> The
prophet directs the attention of his erring people to the fact
that their tribulations are from the Lord:&mdash;"Who gave
Jacob for a spoil and Israel to the robbers? did not the
Lord, he against whom we have sinned? for they would not

<p><b>10.</b> After the captivity of Ephraim, or the kingdom of
Israel, specifically so called, the people of Judah needed yet
other admonishings and threatenings. Through Jeremiah

<p><b>11. Book of Mormon Predictions.</b>&mdash;The record made
by that division of the house of Israel which took its departure
from Jerusalem and made its way to the western
hemisphere about 600 B. C., contains many references to the
dispersions that had already taken place, and to the continuation
of the scattering which was to the writers of the
Book of Mormon yet future. In the course of the journey
to the coast, the prophet Lehi, while encamped with his
family and other followers in the valley of Lemuel on the
borders of the Red Sea, declared what he had learned by
revelation of the future "dwindling of the Jews in unbelief,"
of their crucifying the Messiah, and of their scattering
"upon all the face of the earth."<a name="FNanchor_937_937" id="FNanchor_937_937"></a><a href="#Footnote_937_937" class="fnanchor">[937]</a> He compared Israel
to an olive tree,<a name="FNanchor_938_938" id="FNanchor_938_938"></a><a href="#Footnote_938_938" class="fnanchor">[938]</a> the branches of which were to be broken
off and distributed; and he recognized the exodus of his
colony, and their journeying afar as an incident in the
general plan of dispersion.<a name="FNanchor_939_939" id="FNanchor_939_939"></a><a href="#Footnote_939_939" class="fnanchor">[939]</a> Nephi, the son of Lehi, also
beheld in vision the scattering of the covenant people of
God, and on this point added his testimony to that of his
prophet-father.<a name="FNanchor_940_940" id="FNanchor_940_940"></a><a href="#Footnote_940_940" class="fnanchor">[940]</a> He saw also that the seed of his brethren,
subsequently known as the Lamanites, were to be chastened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
for their unbelief, and that they were destined to become
subject to the Gentiles, and to be scattered before them.<a name="FNanchor_941_941" id="FNanchor_941_941"></a><a href="#Footnote_941_941" class="fnanchor">[941]</a>
Down the prophetic vista of years, he saw also the bringing
forth of sacred records, other than those then known,
"unto the convincing of the Gentiles, and the remnant of
the seed of my brethren,<a name="FNanchor_942_942" id="FNanchor_942_942"></a><a href="#Footnote_942_942" class="fnanchor">[942]</a> and also the Jews who were scattered
upon all the face of the earth."<a name="FNanchor_943_943" id="FNanchor_943_943"></a><a href="#Footnote_943_943" class="fnanchor">[943]</a></p>

<p><b>12.</b> After their arrival on the promised land, the colony
led by Lehi received further information regarding the dispersion
of Israel. The prophet Zenos,<a name="FNanchor_944_944" id="FNanchor_944_944"></a><a href="#Footnote_944_944" class="fnanchor">[944]</a> quoted by Nephi,
had predicted the unbelief of the house of Israel, in consequence
of which these covenant ones of God were to
"wander in the flesh, and perish, and become a hiss and a
by-word, and be hated among all nations."<a name="FNanchor_945_945" id="FNanchor_945_945"></a><a href="#Footnote_945_945" class="fnanchor">[945]</a> The brothers
of Nephi, skeptical in regard to these teachings, asked
whether the things of which he spake were to come to pass
in a spiritual sense, or more literally; and were informed
that "the house of Israel, sooner or later, will be scattered
upon all the face of the earth, and also among all nations";
and further, in reference to dispersions then already accomplished,
that "the more part of all the tribes have been led
away; and they are scattered to and fro upon the isles of
the sea";<a name="FNanchor_946_946" id="FNanchor_946_946"></a><a href="#Footnote_946_946" class="fnanchor">[946]</a> and then, by way of prediction concerning further
division and separation, Nephi adds that the Gentiles shall
be given power over the people of Israel, "and by them
shall our seed be scattered."<a name="FNanchor_947_947" id="FNanchor_947_947"></a><a href="#Footnote_947_947" class="fnanchor">[947]</a> Though an ocean lay
between the country of their nativity and the land
to which they had been miraculously led, the children of
Lehi learned through revelation by the mouth of Jacob,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
Nephi's brother, of the captivity of the Jews whom they
had left at Jerusalem.<a name="FNanchor_948_948" id="FNanchor_948_948"></a><a href="#Footnote_948_948" class="fnanchor">[948]</a> By Nephi they were further told of
troubles then impending over the city of their birth,<a name="FNanchor_949_949" id="FNanchor_949_949"></a><a href="#Footnote_949_949" class="fnanchor">[949]</a> and
of a further dispersion of their kindred, the Jews.<a name="FNanchor_950_950" id="FNanchor_950_950"></a><a href="#Footnote_950_950" class="fnanchor">[950]</a></p>

<p><b>13.</b> The Lamanites, a division of Lehi's colony, were also
to be disrupted and scattered, as witness the words of Samuel,
a prophet of that benighted people.<a name="FNanchor_951_951" id="FNanchor_951_951"></a><a href="#Footnote_951_951" class="fnanchor">[951]</a> Nephi, the third
prophet of that name, grandson of Helaman, emphasizes
the dispersion of his people by declaring that their "dwellings
shall become desolate."<a name="FNanchor_952_952" id="FNanchor_952_952"></a><a href="#Footnote_952_952" class="fnanchor">[952]</a> Jesus Himself, after His resurrection,
while ministering to the division of His flock on
the western hemisphere, refers solemnly to the remnant
of the chosen seed who are to be "scattered forth upon the
face of the earth because of their unbelief."<a name="FNanchor_953_953" id="FNanchor_953_953"></a><a href="#Footnote_953_953" class="fnanchor">[953]</a></p>

<p><b>14.</b> From these references it is plain that the followers
of Lehi, including his own family, and Zoram,<a name="FNanchor_954_954" id="FNanchor_954_954"></a><a href="#Footnote_954_954" class="fnanchor">[954]</a> together
with Ishmael and his family,<a name="FNanchor_955_955" id="FNanchor_955_955"></a><a href="#Footnote_955_955" class="fnanchor">[955]</a> from whom sprang the mighty
peoples the Nephites, who suffered extermination because of
their unfaithfulness, and the Lamanites, who, now known
as the American Indians, have continued in troubled existence
until the present day, were informed by revelation of
the dispersion of their former compatriots in the land of
Palestine, and of their own certain doom as a result of their
disobedience to the laws of God. We have said that the
transfer of Lehi and his followers from the eastern to the
western hemisphere was itself a part of the general dispersion.
It should be remembered that another colony of Jews
came to the western hemisphere, the start dating about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
eleven years after the time of Lehi's departure. This second
company was led by Mulek, a son of Zedekiah the last
king of Judah; they left Jerusalem immediately after the
capture of the city by Nebuchadnezzar, about 588 B. C.<a name="FNanchor_956_956" id="FNanchor_956_956"></a><a href="#Footnote_956_956" class="fnanchor">[956]</a></p>

<p><b>15. The Fulfillment of these Prophecies.</b>&mdash;The sacred
scriptures, as well as other writings for which the claim of
direct inspiration is not asserted, record the literal fulfillment
of prophecy in the desolation of the house of Israel.
The dividing of the nation into the separate kingdoms of
Judah and Israel led to the downfall of both. As the
people grew in their disregard for the laws of their fathers,
their enemies were permitted to triumph over them. After
many minor losses in war, the kingdom of Israel met an
overwhelming defeat at the hands of the Assyrians, in or
about the year 721 B. C. We read that Shalmanezer IV,
king of Assyria, besieged Samaria, the third and last capital
of the kingdom,<a name="FNanchor_957_957" id="FNanchor_957_957"></a><a href="#Footnote_957_957" class="fnanchor">[957]</a> and that after three years the city was
taken by Sargon, Shalmanezer's successor. The people of
Israel were carried captive into Assyria, and distributed
among the cities of the Medes.<a name="FNanchor_958_958" id="FNanchor_958_958"></a><a href="#Footnote_958_958" class="fnanchor">[958]</a> Thus was the dread prediction
of Ahijah to the wife of Jeroboam fulfilled. Israel
was "scattered beyond the river,"<a name="FNanchor_959_959" id="FNanchor_959_959"></a><a href="#Footnote_959_959" class="fnanchor">[959]</a> probably the Euphrates,
and from the time of this event the ten tribes are entirely
lost to history.</p>

<p><b>16.</b> The sad fate of the kingdom of Israel had some
effect in partially awakening among the people of Judah
a sense of their own impending doom. Hezekiah reigned as
king for nine and twenty years, and proved himself a bright
exception to a line of wicked rulers who had preceded him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
Of him we are told that "he did that which was right in
the sight of the Lord."<a name="FNanchor_960_960" id="FNanchor_960_960"></a><a href="#Footnote_960_960" class="fnanchor">[960]</a> During his reign, the Assyrians
under Sennacherib invaded the land; but the Lord's favor
was in part restored to the people, and Hezekiah roused
them to a reliance upon their God, bidding them take courage
and fear not the Assyrian king nor his hosts, "for" said
this righteous prince, "there be more with us than with
him; With him is an arm of flesh, but with us is the Lord
our God, to help us and to fight our battles."<a name="FNanchor_961_961" id="FNanchor_961_961"></a><a href="#Footnote_961_961" class="fnanchor">[961]</a> The Assyrian
army was miraculously destroyed.<a name="FNanchor_962_962" id="FNanchor_962_962"></a><a href="#Footnote_962_962" class="fnanchor">[962]</a> But Hezekiah died,
and Manasseh ruled in his stead; this king did evil in the
sight of the Lord,<a name="FNanchor_963_963" id="FNanchor_963_963"></a><a href="#Footnote_963_963" class="fnanchor">[963]</a> and the wickedness of the people continued
for half a century or more, broken only by the good
works of one righteous king, Josiah.<a name="FNanchor_964_964" id="FNanchor_964_964"></a><a href="#Footnote_964_964" class="fnanchor">[964]</a></p>

<p><b>17.</b> While Zedekiah occupied the throne, Nebuchadnezzar,
king of Babylon, laid siege to Jerusalem,<a name="FNanchor_965_965" id="FNanchor_965_965"></a><a href="#Footnote_965_965" class="fnanchor">[965]</a> took the city
about 588 B. C., and soon thereafter led the people captive
into Babylon, thus virtually putting an end to the kingdom
of Judah. The people were scattered among the cities of
Asia; and groaned under the vicissitudes of the Babylonian
captivity for nearly seventy years,<a name="FNanchor_966_966" id="FNanchor_966_966"></a><a href="#Footnote_966_966" class="fnanchor">[966]</a> after which they were
given permission by Cyrus the Persian, who had subdued the
Babylonians, to return to Jerusalem. Multitudes of the
exiled Hebrews availed themselves of this opportunity,
though many remained in the land of their captivity; and
while those who did return earnestly sought to re-establish
themselves on a scale of their former power, they were never
again truly an independent people. They were assailed by
Syria and Egypt, and later became tributary to Rome, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
which condition they were during the personal ministry of
Christ among them.</p>

<p><b>18.</b> Jeremiah's prophecy still lacked a complete fulfillment,
but time proved that not a word was to fail. "Judah
shall be carried away captive, all of it; it shall be wholly
carried away captive;"<a name="FNanchor_967_967" id="FNanchor_967_967"></a><a href="#Footnote_967_967" class="fnanchor">[967]</a> this was the prediction. A rebellious
disturbance among the Jews gave a semblance of excuse for
a terrible chastisement to be visited upon them by their
Roman masters, which culminated in the destruction of
Jerusalem, A. D. 71. The city fell after a six months' siege
before the Roman arms led by Titus, son of the Emperor
Vespasian. Josephus, the famous historian, to whom we
owe most of our knowledge as to the details of the struggle,
was himself a resident in Galilee and was carried to Rome
among the captives. From his record we learn that more
than a million Jews lost their lives through the famine incident
to the siege; many more were sold into slavery, and
uncounted numbers were forced into exile. The city was
utterly destroyed, and the site upon which the temple had
stood was plowed up by the Romans in their search for
treasure. Thus literally were the words of Christ fulfilled,
"There shall not be left here one stone upon another that
shall not be thrown down."<a name="FNanchor_968_968" id="FNanchor_968_968"></a><a href="#Footnote_968_968" class="fnanchor">[968]</a></p>

<p><b>19.</b> Since the destruction of Jerusalem and the final
disruption of the organized people, the Jews have been
wanderers upon the face of the earth, outcasts among the
nations, a people without a country, a nation without a
home. The prophecy uttered by Amos of old has had its
literal fulfillment: truly have Israel been sifted among all
nations "like as corn is sifted in a sieve;"<a name="FNanchor_969_969" id="FNanchor_969_969"></a><a href="#Footnote_969_969" class="fnanchor">[969]</a> let it be remembered,
however that coupled with this dread prediction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
was the promise, "Yet shall not the least grain fall upon the
earth."</p>

<p><b>20. The Lost Tribes.</b>&mdash;As already stated, in the division
of the Israelites after the death of Solomon, ten tribes
established themselves as an independent kingdom. This,
the kingdom of Israel, was terminated, as far as history is
concerned, by the Assyrian captivity, 721 B. C. The people
were led into Assyria; and later disappeared so completely
that they have been called the Lost Tribes. They seem to
have departed from Assyria, and while we lack definite information
as to their final destination and present location,
there is abundant evidence that their journey was toward the
north.<a name="FNanchor_970_970" id="FNanchor_970_970"></a><a href="#Footnote_970_970" class="fnanchor">[970]</a> The Lord's Word through Jeremiah promises that
the people shall be brought back "from the land of the
north,"<a name="FNanchor_971_971" id="FNanchor_971_971"></a><a href="#Footnote_971_971" class="fnanchor">[971]</a> and a similar declaration has been made through
Divine revelation during the present dispensation.<a name="FNanchor_972_972" id="FNanchor_972_972"></a><a href="#Footnote_972_972" class="fnanchor">[972]</a></p>

<p><b>21.</b> In the writings of Esdras or Ezra, which, however,
are not included among the canonical books of the Bible,
but are known as apocryphal, we find references to the
north-bound migration of the ten tribes, which they undertook
in accordance with a plan to escape the heathen by
going to "a further country where never man dwelt, that
they might there keep their statutes which they never kept
in their own land."<a name="FNanchor_973_973" id="FNanchor_973_973"></a><a href="#Footnote_973_973" class="fnanchor">[973]</a> The same writer informs us further
that they journeyed a year and a half into the north country;
but he gives us evidence that many remained in the
land of their captivity.</p>

<p><b>22.</b> The resurrected Christ, while ministering among the
Nephites on this hemisphere, specifically mentioned "the
other tribes of the house of Israel, whom the Father hath<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
led away out of the land;"<a name="FNanchor_974_974" id="FNanchor_974_974"></a><a href="#Footnote_974_974" class="fnanchor">[974]</a> and again He referred to them
as "other sheep which are not of this land, neither of the
land of Jerusalem; neither in any parts of that land around
about, whither I have been to minister."<a name="FNanchor_975_975" id="FNanchor_975_975"></a><a href="#Footnote_975_975" class="fnanchor">[975]</a> Christ announced
a commandment of the Father that He should reveal Himself
to them. The present location of the Lost Tribes has
not been accurately revealed.</p>

<h3>NOTES.</h3>


<blockquote>

<p><b>1. Hebrews.</b>&mdash;Shem is called "the father of all the children of Eber," as Ham is
called father of Canaan. The Hebrews and Canaanites were often brought into contact,
and exhibited the respective characteristics of the Shemites and the Hamites. The term
"Hebrews" thus is derived from "Eber" (Gen. x, 21; comp. Numb, xxiv, 24).&mdash;<cite>Bible
Cyclopedia</cite>, by Fausset.</p>

<p>The writer of the article "Hebrew" in Cassell's Bible Dictionary questions the evidence
on which the derivation of "Hebrew" from "Eber" or "Heber" is asserted, and
says: "All that can be confidently affirmed is that the term is employed of Abraham,
and of the descendants of Jacob in general. The interest attaching to the word, coupled
with its obscure origin, suffices to account for the many speculations in regard to it. It
may be added that some scholars have found the name 'Hebrews,' a little changed, on
the monuments of Egypt. If this interpretation is verified, it will be of value, as showing
that when the Egyptians called Joseph a Hebrew, they employed the designation
which was accepted among them."</p>

<p><b>2. Jews.</b>&mdash;The term properly signifies "a man of Judah," or a descendant of Judah,
but the word came to be applied to all those who were otherwise designated 'Hebrews.'
It does not appear to have come into use until long after the revolt of Jeroboam and the
ten tribes, and so long as the kingdom stood, it was naturally employed of the citizens of
the kingdom of Judah (II Kings xvi, 6; xxv, 25); but it rarely occurs in this sense.
After the exile it took the extension of meaning which it has to the present day. It was
adopted by the remnants of all the tribes, and was the one name by which the descendants
of Jacob were known throughout the ancient world; certainly it was far more
common than 'Hebrew.' It occurs in the books of Ezra, Nehemiah, Esther, Daniel, etc.,
is found in the Apocrypha; and is common in Josephus, and in the New Testament."&mdash;<cite>Cassell's
Bible Dictionary</cite>.</p>

<p>"Under the theocracy they were known as Hebrews, under the monarchy as Israelites,
and during foreign domination as Jews. The modern representatives of this stock call
themselves Hebrews in race and language, and Israelites in religion, but Jews in both
senses."&mdash;<cite>Standard Dictionary</cite>.</p>

<p><b>3. Zenos.</b>&mdash;"A Hebrew prophet, often quoted by the Nephite servants of God. All
we are told of his personal history is that he was slain because he testified boldly of what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
God revealed to him. That he was a man greatly blessed of the Lord with the spirit of
prophecy is shown by that wonderful and almost incomparable parable of the Vineyard,
given at length by Jacob (Jacob, chap. v). His prophecies are also quoted by Nephi (I
Nephi xix, 10, 12, 16), Alma (Alma xxxiii, 3, 13, 15), Amulek, Alma (xxxiv, 7), Samuel
the Lamanite (Helaman xv, 11), and Mormon (III Nephi x, 16)."&mdash;<cite>Dictionary of the Book
of Mormon</cite>, by Elder George Reynolds.</p>

<p><b>4. The Journeyings of the Lost Tribes.</b>&mdash;Esdras, whose books, as stated
in the text, are classed among the apocrypha, describes a vision, in the course of which
the Ten Tribes are noticed in this way:&mdash;"Those are the tribes which were carried away
captives out of their own land in the time of Oseas [Hosea] the king, whom Shalmanezer,
the king of the Assyrians, took captive, and crossed them beyond the river; so were they
brought into another land. But they took counsel to themselves, that they would leave
the multitude of the heathen, and go forth unto a further country where never man
dwelt, that they there might keep their statutes, which they never kept in their own land.
And they entered in at the narrow passage of the river Euphrates. For the Most High
then showed them signs, and stayed the springs of the flood till they were passed over.
For through the country there was a great journey, even of a year and a half, and the
same region is called Arsareth (or Ararah). Then dwelt they there until the latter time,
and when they come forth again, the Most High shall hold still the springs of the river
again, that they may go through."&mdash;II Esdras xiii.</p>

<p>Concerning the journeyings of the Ten Tribes toward the north, Elder George
Reynolds, in his little work <cite>Are We of Israel?</cite> says:&mdash;"They determined to go to a
country 'where never man dwelt,' that they might be free from all contaminating influences.
That country could only be found in the north. Southern Asia was already the
seat of a comparatively ancient civilization; Egypt flourished in northern Africa; and
southern Europe was rapidly filling with the future rulers of the world. They had therefore
no choice but to turn their faces northward. The first portion of their journey was
not however north; according to the account of Esdras, they appear to have at first
moved in the direction of their old home; and it is possible that they originally started
with the intention of returning thereto; or probably, in order to deceive the Assyrians,
they started as if to return to Canaan, and when they crossed the Euphrates and were
out of danger from the hosts of Medes and Persians, then they turned their journeying
feet toward the polar star. Esdras states that they entered in at the narrow passage of
the river Euphrates, the Lord staying the springs of the flood until they were passed
over. The point on the river Euphrates at which they crossed would necessarily be in
its upper portion, as lower down would be too far south for their purpose. The upper
course of the Euphrates lies among lofty mountains; near the village of Pastash it
plunges through a gorge formed by precipices more than a thousand feet in height, and
so narrow that it is bridged at the top; it shortly afterward enters the plain of Mesopotamia.
How accurately this portion of the river answers to the description of Esdras of
the 'Narrows' where the Israelites crossed!"</p>

<p>"The tribes shall come; they are not lost unto the Lord; they shall be
brought forth as hath been predicted; and I say unto you there are those now
living&mdash;aye, some here present&mdash;who shall live to read the records of the Lost
Tribes of Israel, which shall be made one with the record of the Jews, or the
Holy Bible, and the record of the Nephites, or the Book of Mormon, even as the
Lord hath predicted; and those records, which the tribes lost to man but yet to
be found again shall bring, shall tell of the visit of the resurrected Christ to
them, after He had manifested Himself to the Nephites upon this continent."

amounting, as it did, to their dissolution as a nation, and to
a virtual expulsion from the sight of the Lord's favor;
fearful as has been their denunciation by Him who delighted
to call them His people; through all their sufferings and
deprivations, while wandering as outcasts among alien
nations who have never ceased to treat them with contumely
and insult, when their very name has been made a hiss and
a byword in the earth;&mdash;they have ever been sustained by
the sure word of Divine promise, that a day of glorious
deliverance and blessed restoration awaits them. Associated
with the curses under which they writhed and groaned, were
assurances of blessings. From the heart of the people, as
from the soul of their mighty king in the day of his deserved
affliction, has poured forth a song of tearful rejoicing:&mdash;"Thou
wilt not leave my soul in hell."<a name="FNanchor_976_976" id="FNanchor_976_976"></a><a href="#Footnote_976_976" class="fnanchor">[976]</a> The sufferings
of Israel have been but necessary chastening by a

<p><b>2.</b> Though smitten of men, a large part of them gone
from a knowledge of the world, Israel are not lost unto
their Father; He knows whither they have been led or
driven; toward them His heart still yearns with paternal
love; and surely will He bring them forth, in due time and
by appointed means, into a condition of favor and power,
befitting His chosen and covenant people. In spite of their
sin, and the tribulations which they would assuredly bring
upon themselves, the Lord said:&mdash;"And yet for all that,

<p><b>3. Bible Prophecies concerning the Gathering.</b>&mdash;We have
examined a few of the biblical predictions concerning the
dispersion of Israel; in all cases the blessing of eventual
restoration was associated with the curse. Among the early
prophecies, we hear the Lord declaring that it shall come to
pass that when thou, Israel, "shalt return unto the Lord
thy God, and shalt obey his voice according to all that I
command thee this day, thou and thy children, with all
thine heart, and with all thy soul; that then the Lord thy
God will turn thy captivity, and have compassion upon
thee, and will return and gather thee from all the nations,
whither the Lord thy God hath scattered thee. If any of
thine be driven out unto the utmost parts of heaven, from
thence will the Lord thy God gather thee, and from thence
will he fetch thee: and the Lord thy God will bring thee
into the land which thy fathers possessed, and thou shalt
possess it; and he will do thee good, and multiply thee
above thy fathers."<a name="FNanchor_980_980" id="FNanchor_980_980"></a><a href="#Footnote_980_980" class="fnanchor">[980]</a></p>

<p><b>11. Book of Mormon Prophecies.</b>&mdash;The gathering of Israel
claimed the attention of many prophets whose teachings are
recorded in the Book of Mormon, and not a little direct
revelation concerning the subject is preserved within the
pages of that volume. We have noted Lehi's discourse in
the valley of Lemuel, in which that patriarch-prophet compared
the house of Israel to an olive tree, the branches
of which were to be broken off and scattered; now may
we add his prediction regarding the subsequent grafting-in
of the branches. He taught that, "after the house of
Israel shall be scattered, they should be gathered together
again; or, in fine, after the Gentiles had received the fulness
of the Gospel, the natural branches of the olive tree, or the
remnants of the house of Israel, should be grafted in, or
come to a knowledge of the true Messiah, their Lord and
their Redeemer."<a name="FNanchor_991_991" id="FNanchor_991_991"></a><a href="#Footnote_991_991" class="fnanchor">[991]</a></p>

<p><b>12.</b> Nephi, quoting the words of the prophet Zenos,<a name="FNanchor_992_992" id="FNanchor_992_992"></a><a href="#Footnote_992_992" class="fnanchor">[992]</a>
emphasizes the declaration that, when purified by suffering,
Israel shall come again into the favor of the Lord, and then
shall they be gathered from the four quarters of the earth,
and the isles of the sea shall be remembered.<a name="FNanchor_993_993" id="FNanchor_993_993"></a><a href="#Footnote_993_993" class="fnanchor">[993]</a> Jacob, the
brother of Nephi, testified to the truth of the prophecies of
Zenos, and indicated the time of the gathering as a characteristic
sign of the last days. Consider his words:&mdash;"And
in the day that he shall set his hand again the second time,
to recover his people, is the day, yea, even the last time
that the servants of the Lord shall go forth in his power, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>

<p><b>13.</b> Among the most comprehensive predictions regarding
the restoration of the Jews is the following utterance
of Nephi:&mdash;"Wherefore, the Jews shall be scattered among
all nations; yea, and also Babylon shall be destroyed;
wherefore, the Jews shall be scattered by other nations;
and after they have been scattered, and the Lord God hath
scourged them by other nations, for the space of many
generations, yea, even down from generation to generation,
until they shall be persuaded to believe in Christ, the Son
of God, and the atonement, which is infinite for all mankind;
and when that day shall come, that they shall believe
in Christ, and worship the Father in his name, with
pure hearts and clean hands, and look not forward any
more for another Messiah, then, at that time, the day will
come that it must needs to be expedient that they should
believe these things, and the Lord will set his hand again
the second time to restore his people from their lost and
fallen state. Wherefore, he will proceed to do a marvelous
work and a wonder among the children of men."<a name="FNanchor_995_995" id="FNanchor_995_995"></a><a href="#Footnote_995_995" class="fnanchor">[995]</a></p>

<p><b>14.</b> Nephi, commenting on the words of Isaiah regarding
the sufferings and subsequent triumph of the people of
Israel, states the condition upon which their gathering is
predicated, and says of God:&mdash;"That he has spoken unto
the Jews, by the mouth of his holy prophets, even from the
beginning down, from generation to generation, until the
time comes that they shall be restored to the true church
and fold of God; when they shall be gathered home to the
lands of their inheritance, and shall be established in all
their lands of promise."<a name="FNanchor_996_996" id="FNanchor_996_996"></a><a href="#Footnote_996_996" class="fnanchor">[996]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span></p>
<p><b>15.</b> It is evident from these and many other passages that
the time of the Jews' return is to be determined by their
acceptance of Christ as their Lord. When that time comes,
they are to be gathered to the land of their fathers; and in
the work of gathering, the Gentiles are destined to take a
great and honorable part, as witness the further words of
Nephi:&mdash;"But behold, thus saith the Lord God: When the
day cometh that they shall believe in me, that I am Christ,
then have I covenanted with their fathers that they shall be
restored in the flesh, upon the earth, unto the lands of their
inheritance. And it shall come to pass that they shall be
gathered in from their long dispersion, from the isles of the
sea, and from the four parts of the earth; and the nations
of the Gentiles shall be great in the eyes of me, saith God,
in carrying them forth to the land of their inheritance.
Yea, the kings of the Gentiles shall be nursing fathers unto
them, and their queens shall become nursing mothers; wherefore,
the promises of the Lord are great unto the Gentiles,
for he hath spoken it, and who can dispute?"<a name="FNanchor_997_997" id="FNanchor_997_997"></a><a href="#Footnote_997_997" class="fnanchor">[997]</a></p>

<p><b>16.</b> The assistance which the Gentiles are to give in the
preparation of the Jews, and of the remnant of the house
of Israel established on the western continent, is affirmed
by several Book of Mormon prophets; and, moreover,

are described in detail.<a name="FNanchor_998_998" id="FNanchor_998_998"></a><a href="#Footnote_998_998" class="fnanchor">[998]</a> A single quotation must

hearken unto my words, and harden not their hearts, I
will establish my church among them, and they shall come
in unto the covenant, and be numbered among this the

of Jacob, and also, as many of the house of Israel
as shall come, that they may build a city, which shall be
called the New Jerusalem; and then shall they assist my
people that they may be gathered in, who are scattered upon
all the face of the land, in unto the New Jerusalem. And
then shall the power of heaven come down among them; and
I also will be in the midst; and then shall the work of the
Father commence at that day, even when this gospel shall be
preached among the remnant of this people. Verily I say
unto you, at that day shall the work of the Father commence
among all the dispersed of my people; yea, even the
tribes which have been lost, which the Father hath led away
out of Jerusalem. Yea, the work shall commence among
all the dispersed of my people, with the Father, to prepare
the way whereby they may come unto me, that they may
call on the Father in my name; yea, and then shall the
work commence, with the Father, among all nations, in

home to the land of their inheritance."<a name="FNanchor_999_999" id="FNanchor_999_999"></a><a href="#Footnote_999_999" class="fnanchor">[999]</a></p>

<p><b>17. Modern Revelation Concerning the Gathering.</b>&mdash;We
have found abundant proof of the severely literal fulfilment
of prophecies relating to Israel's dispersion. The predictions
relative to the gathering have been but partly fulfilled;
for, while the work of concentration has been well begun,
and is now in active progress, the consummation of the
labor is yet future. It is reasonable, then, to look for revelation
and prophecy concerning the subject, in modern
scripture as well as in the inspired writings of former times.
Speaking to the elders of the Church in this dispensation,
the Lord declares His purpose to gather His people "even as
a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings,"<a name="FNanchor_1000_1000" id="FNanchor_1000_1000"></a><a href="#Footnote_1000_1000" class="fnanchor">[1000]</a> and adds:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
"And ye are called to bring to pass the gathering of mine
elect, for mine elect hear my voice, and harden not their
hearts; wherefore the decree hath gone forth from the
Father, that they shall be gathered in unto one place upon
the face of this land, to prepare their hearts and be prepared
in all things against the day when tribulation and
desolation are sent forth upon the wicked."<a name="FNanchor_1001_1001" id="FNanchor_1001_1001"></a><a href="#Footnote_1001_1001" class="fnanchor">[1001]</a></p>

<p><b>18.</b> Hear further the word of the Lord unto the people
of His Church in the present day, not only predicting the
gathering of the Saints to Zion, but announcing that the
hour for the gathering has come:&mdash;"Wherefore, prepare ye,
prepare ye, O my people; sanctify yourselves; gather ye
together, O ye people of my Church.... Yea, verily
I say unto you again, the time has come when the voice of
the Lord is unto you, go ye out of Babylon, gather ye out
from among the nations, from the four winds, from one end
of heaven to the other."<a name="FNanchor_1002_1002" id="FNanchor_1002_1002"></a><a href="#Footnote_1002_1002" class="fnanchor">[1002]</a></p>

<p><b>19. Extent and Purpose of the Gathering.</b>&mdash;Some of the
prophecies already cited have special reference to the restoration
of the Ten Tribes; others relate to the return of the
people of Judah to the land of their inheritance; yet others
refer to the re-establishment of Israel in general, without
mention of tribal or other divisions; while many passages in
the revelations of the present dispensation deal with the
gathering of the Saints who have numbered themselves with
the Church of Christ as re-established. It is evident that
the plan of gathering comprises:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1. Return of the Jews to Jerusalem.</p>

<p>2. Restoration of the Ten Tribes.</p>

<p>3. Assembling in the land of Zion of the people of Israel
from the nations of the earth.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span></p>

<p><b>20.</b> The sequence of these subdivisions as here presented,
is that of convenience only, and has no significance
as to the order in which the work is to be done. The division
last named constitutes the present great work of the
Church, though the labor of assisting in the restoration of
the Lost Tribes is included. We are informed by revelation,
given in the Kirtland Temple, that the appointment to and
the authority for this work were solemnly committed to the
Church. And through whom should such authority be expected
to come? Surely through him who had received it
by Divine commission in a former dispensation of united
Israel. Moses, who was the chief representative of Israel's
God when the Lord set His hand the first time to lead His
people to the land of their appointed inheritance, has come
in person and has committed to the latter-day Church the
authority to minister in the work now that the Lord has
"set his hand the second time" to recover His people.</p>

<p><b>21.</b> Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery, each of whom
had been duly ordained to the apostleship, testify of the
manifestations made to them, in these words:&mdash;"The
heavens were again opened unto us, and Moses appeared
before us, and committed unto us the keys of the gathering
of Israel from the four parts of the earth, and the leading
of the ten tribes from the land of the north."<a name="FNanchor_1003_1003" id="FNanchor_1003_1003"></a><a href="#Footnote_1003_1003" class="fnanchor">[1003]</a> The importance
of the work thus required of the Church was emphasized by
a later revelation, in which the Lord gave this command:&mdash;"Send
forth the elders of my church unto the nations which
are afar off; unto the islands of the sea; send forth unto foreign
lands; call upon all nations; firstly upon the Gentiles, and
then upon the Jews. And behold, and lo, this shall be their
cry, and the voice of the Lord unto all people: Go ye forth
unto the land of Zion.... Let them, therefore, who are
among the Gentiles flee unto Zion. And let them who be of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
Judah flee unto Jerusalem, unto the mountain of the Lord's
house. Go ye out from among the nations, even from Babylon,
from the midst of wickedness, which is spiritual Babylon."<a name="FNanchor_1004_1004" id="FNanchor_1004_1004"></a><a href="#Footnote_1004_1004" class="fnanchor">[1004]</a></p>

<p><b>22.</b> The last sentence of the foregoing quotation expresses
the purpose for which this work of gathering the
Saints from the nations of the earth has been ordained.
The Lord would have His people separate themselves from
the sins of the world, and depart from spiritual Babylon,
that they may learn the ways of God and serve Him the
more fully. John the Revelator, while in exile on Patmos,
saw in vision the fate of the sinful world. An angel came
down from heaven, "and he cried mightily with a strong
voice, saying, Babylon the great is fallen, is fallen, and is
become the habitation of devils, and the hold of every foul
spirit, and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird....
And I heard another voice from heaven, saying, Come out
of her, my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and
that ye receive not of her plagues. For her sins have reached
unto heaven, and God hath remembered her iniquities."<a name="FNanchor_1005_1005" id="FNanchor_1005_1005"></a><a href="#Footnote_1005_1005" class="fnanchor">[1005]</a></p>

<p><b>23.</b> The faith of the Saints teaches that in the day of the
Lord's righteous fury, safety will be found in Zion. The
importance which the Latter-day Saints associate with the
work of gathering, and the fidelity with which they seek to
discharge the duty enjoined upon them by Divine authority
in the matter of warning the world of the impending dangers,
as described in the Revelator's vision, are sufficiently
demonstrated by the great extent of the missionary labor as
at present prosecuted by this people.<a name="FNanchor_1006_1006" id="FNanchor_1006_1006"></a><a href="#Footnote_1006_1006" class="fnanchor">[1006]</a></p>

and in turn upon Jacob who was called Israel.<a name="FNanchor_1011_1011" id="FNanchor_1011_1011"></a><a href="#Footnote_1011_1011" class="fnanchor">[1011]</a> The promises
regarding the multitudinous posterity, among whom
were to be counted many of royal rank, have been literally
fulfilled. No less certain is the realization of the second
part of the prediction, that in and through Abraham's descendants
should all nations of the earth be blessed. For,
by a world-wide dispersion, the children of Israel have been
mingled with the nations; and the blood of the chosen seed
has been sprinkled among the peoples.<a name="FNanchor_1012_1012" id="FNanchor_1012_1012"></a><a href="#Footnote_1012_1012" class="fnanchor">[1012]</a> And now, in this
the day of gathering, when the Lord is again bringing His
people together to honor and bless them above all that the
world can give, every nation with the blood of Israel in the
veins of its members will partake of the blessings.</p>

<p><b>25.</b> But there is another and a more striking proof of
blessings flowing to all nations through the house of Israel.
Was not the Redeemer born in the flesh through the lineage
of Abraham? Surely the blessings of that Divine birth
are extended, not only to the nations and families of the
earth collectively, but to every individual in mortality.</p>

<p><b>26. Restoration of the Ten Tribes.</b>&mdash;From the scriptural
passages already considered, it is plain that, while many of
those belonging to the Ten Tribes were dispersed among the
nations, a sufficient number to justify the retention of the
original name were led away as a body, and are now in existence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
in some place where the Lord has hidden them.
To them Christ went to minister after His visit to the
Nephites, as before stated.<a name="FNanchor_1013_1013" id="FNanchor_1013_1013"></a><a href="#Footnote_1013_1013" class="fnanchor">[1013]</a> Their return constitutes a very
important part of the gathering, characteristic of the dispensation
of the fullness of times.</p>

<p><b>27.</b> To the scriptures already quoted as relating to their
return, the following should be added: As a feature of the
work of God in the day of restoration we are told:&mdash;"And
they who are in the north countries shall come in remembrance
before the Lord, and their prophets shall hear his
voice, and shall no longer stay themselves, and they shall
smite the rocks, and the ice shall flow down at their presence.
And an highway shall be cast up in the midst of the
great deep. Their enemies shall become a prey unto them.
And in the barren deserts there shall come forth pools of
living water; and the parched ground shall no longer be
a thirsty land. And they shall bring forth their rich
treasures unto the children of Ephraim my servants.
And the boundaries of the everlasting hills shall tremble at
their presence. And there shall they fall down, and be
crowned with glory, even in Zion, by the hands of the
servants of the Lord, even the children of Ephraim; and
they shall be filled with songs of everlasting joy. Behold
this is the blessing of the everlasting God upon the tribes
of Israel, and the richer blessing upon the head of Ephraim
and his fellows."<a name="FNanchor_1014_1014" id="FNanchor_1014_1014"></a><a href="#Footnote_1014_1014" class="fnanchor">[1014]</a></p>

<p><b>28.</b> From the express and repeated declaration, that in their
exodus from the north the Ten Tribes are to be led to Zion,
there to receive honor at the hands of some of the children
of Ephraim, who necessarily are to have previously gathered
there, it is plain that Zion is to be first established. The establishment
of Zion will receive attention in the next lecture.</p>

<h3>NOTES.</h3>

<blockquote>

<p><b>1. Gathering Now in Progress.</b>&mdash;The Latter-day Saints "are building up
stakes of Zion in the Rocky Mountain valleys, and in this way are fulfilling predictions
of the ancient prophets. Isaiah hath it written, 'And it shall come to pass in the last
days, that the mountain of the Lord's house shall be established in the top of the mountains,
and shall be exalted above the hills; and all nations shall flow unto it. And many
people shall go and say, Come ye, and let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, to the
house of the God of Jacob; and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths;
for out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem' (Isaiah
ii, 2-3). It is remarkable how minutely the Latter-day Saints are fulfilling the terms of
this prophecy: 1. They are building the temples of God in the tops of the mountains,
so that the house of the Lord is truly where Isaiah saw it would be. 2. The Saints engaged
in this work are people gathered from nearly all the nations under heaven, so that
all nations are flowing unto the house of the Lord in the top of the mountains. 3. The
people who receive the gospel in foreign lands joyfully say to their relatives and friends:
Come ye, and let us go up to the house of the Lord, and he will teach us of his ways and
we will walk in his paths."&mdash;Roberts' <cite>Outlines of Ecclesiastical History</cite>, p. 409.</p>

<p><b>2. Israel a Chosen People.</b>&mdash;"The promise to Abram that he should become
a great nation, has been fulfilled in his chosen seed occupying the land of Palestine, as
such, for fifteen hundred years. It will again be fulfilled when they become a nation on
that land forever. The history of the eastern hemisphere for the two thousand years
which intervened between the calling of Abraham and the destruction of Jerusalem by
the Romans, witnesses that every nation that fought against Israel, or in any way
oppressed them, passed away. Time will show the same general result from the destruction
of Jerusalem to the millennium. The Prophet Isaiah, speaking of the time when
the Lord should favor Israel, said, 'All they that were incensed against thee shall be
ashamed and confounded: they shall be as nothing; and they that strive with thee shall
perish' (xli, 11). 'I will feed them that oppress thee with their own flesh; and they
shall be drunken with their own blood' (xlix, 27). 'I have taken out of thine hand
the cup of trembling, even the dregs of the cup of my fury; thou shalt no more drink of
it again: but I will put it into the hand of them that afflict thee; which have said to thy
soul, Bow down, that we may go over.'"&mdash;<cite>A Compendium of the Doctrines of the Gospel</cite>,
by Elders Franklin D. Richards and James A. Little, pp. 246-247.</p>

<p><b>3. Israel Among the Nations.</b>&mdash;"When we reflect that it is thirty-two centuries
since the enemies of Israel began to oppress them in the land of Canaan, that about one-third
of the time they were a people in that land they were more or less in bondage to
their enemies; that seven hundred years before the coming of Christ the ten tribes were
scattered throughout western Asia; that we have no record that any have as yet returned
to the land of their inheritance; that nearly six hundred years before Christ, the Babylonish
captivity took place, and that, according to the Book of Esther, only a small part
of the Jews ever returned, but were scattered through the 127 provinces of the Persian
empire; that Asia was the hive from which swarmed the nomadic tribes who over-ran
Europe; that at the destruction of Jerusalem by the Romans the Jews were scattered
over the known world; we may well ask the question, Does not Israel to-day constitute
a large proportion of the human family?"&mdash;<cite>Compendium</cite>, by Elders F. D. Richards and
James A. Little, p. 90.</p></blockquote>

<h3>ZION.</h3>

<blockquote>

<p><b>Article 10.</b>&mdash;We believe ... That Zion will be built upon this [the American]
continent, etc.</p></blockquote>


<p><b>1. Two Gathering Places.</b>&mdash;Some of the passages quoted
in connection with the dispersion and the subsequent
re-union of Israel, make reference to Jerusalem which is to
be re-established, and Zion which is to be built. True, the
latter name is in many cases used as a synonym of the first,
owing to the fact that a certain hill within the Jerusalem
of old was known specifically as Zion, or Mount Zion; and
the name of a part is often used figuratively to designate
the whole; but in other passages, the separate and distinctive
meaning of the terms is clear. The prophet Micah,
who ministered during the seventh century before the birth
of Christ, "full of power by the spirit of the Lord, and of
judgment, and of might,"<a name="FNanchor_1015_1015" id="FNanchor_1015_1015"></a><a href="#Footnote_1015_1015" class="fnanchor">[1015]</a> predicted the destruction of
Jerusalem and its associated Zion, the former to "become
heaps," and the latter to be "plowed as a field;"<a name="FNanchor_1016_1016" id="FNanchor_1016_1016"></a><a href="#Footnote_1016_1016" class="fnanchor">[1016]</a> and then
announced a new condition which is to exist in the last
days, when another "mountain of the house of the Lord"
is to be established, and this is to be called Zion.<a name="FNanchor_1017_1017" id="FNanchor_1017_1017"></a><a href="#Footnote_1017_1017" class="fnanchor">[1017]</a> The two
places are mentioned separately in the prophecy:&mdash;"For
the law shall go forth of Zion, and the word of the Lord
from Jerusalem."<a name="FNanchor_1018_1018" id="FNanchor_1018_1018"></a><a href="#Footnote_1018_1018" class="fnanchor">[1018]</a></p>

<p><b>2.</b> Joel adds this testimony regarding the two places
from which the Lord shall rule over His people:&mdash;"The
Lord also shall roar out of Zion, and utter his voice from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
Jerusalem."<a name="FNanchor_1019_1019" id="FNanchor_1019_1019"></a><a href="#Footnote_1019_1019" class="fnanchor">[1019]</a> Zephaniah breaks forth into song, with the
triumph of Israel as his theme, and addresses the daughters
of both cities:&mdash;"Sing, O daughter of Zion; shout, O Israel;
be glad and rejoice with all the heart, O daughter of Jerusalem."<a name="FNanchor_1020_1020" id="FNanchor_1020_1020"></a><a href="#Footnote_1020_1020" class="fnanchor">[1020]</a>
Then, the prophet predicts separately of each
place:&mdash;"In that day it shall be said to Jerusalem, Fear thou
not: and to Zion, Let not thine hands be slack."<a name="FNanchor_1021_1021" id="FNanchor_1021_1021"></a><a href="#Footnote_1021_1021" class="fnanchor">[1021]</a> Furthermore,
Zechariah records the revealed will in this way:&mdash;"And
the Lord shall yet comfort Zion, and shall yet choose
Jerusalem."<a name="FNanchor_1022_1022" id="FNanchor_1022_1022"></a><a href="#Footnote_1022_1022" class="fnanchor">[1022]</a></p>

<p><b>3.</b> When the people of the house of Jacob are prepared
to receive the Redeemer as their rightful king, when the
scattered sheep of Israel, have been sufficiently humbled
through suffering and sorrow to know and to follow their
Shepherd, then, indeed, will He come to reign among them.
Then a literal kingdom will be established, wide as the
world, with the King of Kings on the throne; and the two
capitals of this mighty empire will be, Jerusalem on the
eastern hemisphere, and Zion on the western. Isaiah speaks
of the glory of Christ's kingdom in the latter days, and
ascribes separately to Zion and to Jerusalem the blessings of
triumph:<a name="FNanchor_1023_1023" id="FNanchor_1023_1023"></a><a href="#Footnote_1023_1023" class="fnanchor">[1023]</a>&mdash;"O Zion, that bringest good tidings, get thee up
into the high mountain; O Jerusalem, that bringest good
tidings, lift up thy voice with strength; lift it up, be not
afraid; say unto the cities of Judah, behold your God."<a name="FNanchor_1024_1024" id="FNanchor_1024_1024"></a><a href="#Footnote_1024_1024" class="fnanchor">[1024]</a></p>

<p><b>4. The Name "Zion"</b> is used in several distinct senses.
By derivation, the word <em>Zion</em>, or, as written by the Greeks,
<i lang="el" xml:lang="el">Sion</i>, probably meant <em>bright</em>, or <em>sunny</em>; but this commonplace
signification is lost in the deeper and more affecting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
meaning which the word as a name and title came to
acquire. As stated, a particular hill within the site of the
city of Jerusalem was called Zion. When David gained his
victory over the Jebusites, he captured and occupied the
"stronghold of Zion," and named it the city of David.<a name="FNanchor_1025_1025" id="FNanchor_1025_1025"></a><a href="#Footnote_1025_1025" class="fnanchor">[1025]</a>
"Zion" then was the name of a place; and it has been
applied as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>1. To the hill itself, or Mount Zion, and, by extension
of meaning, to Jerusalem.</p>

<p>2. To the location of the "mountain of the house of the
Lord," which Micah predicts shall be established in the last
days, distinct from Jerusalem. To these we may add
another application of the name as made known through
modern revelation, viz.:</p>

<p>3. To the city of Holiness, founded by Enoch, the seventh
patriarch in descent from Adam, and called by him Zion.<a name="FNanchor_1026_1026" id="FNanchor_1026_1026"></a><a href="#Footnote_1026_1026" class="fnanchor">[1026]</a></p>

<p>4. Yet another use of the term is to be noted&mdash;viz.: a
metaphorical one&mdash;by which the Church of God is called
Zion, comprising, according to the Lord's own definition,
the pure in heart.<a name="FNanchor_1027_1027" id="FNanchor_1027_1027"></a><a href="#Footnote_1027_1027" class="fnanchor">[1027]</a></p></blockquote>

<p><b>5. Jerusalem.</b>&mdash;As a fitting introduction to our study
regarding the new Zion, yet to be built, as we shall presently
see, on the western hemisphere, let us briefly consider the
history and destiny of Jerusalem,<a name="FNanchor_1028_1028" id="FNanchor_1028_1028"></a><a href="#Footnote_1028_1028" class="fnanchor">[1028]</a> the Zion of the eastern
continent. The word Jerusalem is generally believed to
mean by derivation the <em>foundation</em> or <em>city of peace</em>. We
meet it for the first time as Salem, the abode of Melchizedek,
high-priest and king, to whom Abram paid tithes, in
the nineteenth century before Christ.<a name="FNanchor_1029_1029" id="FNanchor_1029_1029"></a><a href="#Footnote_1029_1029" class="fnanchor">[1029]</a> We find a direct
statement concerning the identity of Salem and Jerusalem
by Josephus.<a name="FNanchor_1030_1030" id="FNanchor_1030_1030"></a><a href="#Footnote_1030_1030" class="fnanchor">[1030]</a> As noted, the city was wrested from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
Jebusites by David;<a name="FNanchor_1031_1031" id="FNanchor_1031_1031"></a><a href="#Footnote_1031_1031" class="fnanchor">[1031]</a> this was about 1048 B.C. During the
reigns of David and Solomon, the city as the capital of the
kingdom of undivided Israel acquired great fame for its
riches, beauty, and strength, its chief attraction being
the marvelous temple of Solomon which adorned Mount
Moriah.<a name="FNanchor_1032_1032" id="FNanchor_1032_1032"></a><a href="#Footnote_1032_1032" class="fnanchor">[1032]</a> After the division of the kingdom, Jerusalem
remained the capital of the smaller kingdom of Judah.</p>

<p><b>6.</b> Among its many and varied vicissitudes incident to the
fortunes of war,<a name="FNanchor_1033_1033" id="FNanchor_1033_1033"></a><a href="#Footnote_1033_1033" class="fnanchor">[1033]</a> may be mentioned:&mdash;the destruction of the
city and the enslaving of the inhabitants by Nebuchadnezzar,
588-585 B.C.;<a name="FNanchor_1034_1034" id="FNanchor_1034_1034"></a><a href="#Footnote_1034_1034" class="fnanchor">[1034]</a> its re-establishment at the close of the
Babylonian captivity<a name="FNanchor_1035_1035" id="FNanchor_1035_1035"></a><a href="#Footnote_1035_1035" class="fnanchor">[1035]</a> (about 515 B.C.); and its final overthrow
at the disruption of the Jewish nation by the Romans,
70-71 A.D. In importance, and in the love of the Jews,
the city was the very heart of Jewry: and in the estimation
of Christians, it has ever been invested with sanctity.
It occupied an important place in the earthly mission
of the Redeemer, and was the scene of His death,
resurrection, and ascension. The Savior's high regard for
the chief city of His people is beyond question. He forbade
that any should swear by it, "for it is the city of the
great King;"<a name="FNanchor_1036_1036" id="FNanchor_1036_1036"></a><a href="#Footnote_1036_1036" class="fnanchor">[1036]</a> and because of its sins, He lamented over it as
a father for a wayward child.<a name="FNanchor_1037_1037" id="FNanchor_1037_1037"></a><a href="#Footnote_1037_1037" class="fnanchor">[1037]</a></p>

<p><b>7.</b> But, great as is Jerusalem's past, a yet greater future
awaits her. Again will the city become a royal seat, her throne
that of the King of Kings, with permanency of glory assured.</p>

<p><b>8. The Latter-day Zion; New Jerusalem.</b>&mdash;The biblical
statements concerning the Zion of the last days as separate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
from the ancient or the re-established Jerusalem of the east,
are silent regarding the geographical location of this second
and modern capital of Christ's kingdom. We learn something,
however, from the Bible as to the physical characteristics
of the region wherein Zion is to be built. Thus, Micah,
after predicting the desolation of the hill, Mount Zion, and
of Jerusalem in general, describes in contrast the new Zion,
wherein the house of the Lord is to be built in the last days.
These are his words:&mdash;"But in the last days it shall come to
pass, that the mountain of the house of the Lord shall be
established in the top of the mountains, and it shall be
exalted above the hills; and people shall flow unto it. And
many nations shall come, and say, Come, and let us go up
to the mountain of the Lord, and to the house of the God
of Jacob; and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk
in his paths; for the law shall go forth of Zion, and the
word of the Lord from Jerusalem."<a name="FNanchor_1038_1038" id="FNanchor_1038_1038"></a><a href="#Footnote_1038_1038" class="fnanchor">[1038]</a></p>

<p><b>9.</b> The prophecy of Isaiah is not less explicit regarding
the mountainous character of the country of modern Zion;<a name="FNanchor_1039_1039" id="FNanchor_1039_1039"></a><a href="#Footnote_1039_1039" class="fnanchor">[1039]</a>
and, furthermore, this writer assures us that the righteous
man only shall be able to dwell amid the fiery splendor of
this new abode; and of him the prophet says:&mdash;"He shall
dwell on high: his place of defence shall be the munitions
of rocks;" and adds the statement that the land shall be
very far off.<a name="FNanchor_1040_1040" id="FNanchor_1040_1040"></a><a href="#Footnote_1040_1040" class="fnanchor">[1040]</a> In another passage, he mentions a gathering
place "beyond the rivers of Ethiopia," and, "on the mountains"
where the Lord is to "set up an ensign" to the world.<a name="FNanchor_1041_1041" id="FNanchor_1041_1041"></a><a href="#Footnote_1041_1041" class="fnanchor">[1041]</a></p>

<p><b>10.</b> The teachings of the Book of Mormon, and the
truths made known through revelation in the present dispensation,
regarding the Zion of the last days, while agreeing
with the biblical record as to the general description of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
the situation, and the glories of the city, are more explicit
in regard to the location. In these scriptures, the names
Zion and New Jerusalem are used synonymously, the latter
designation being given in honor of the Jerusalem of the
east. John the Revelator saw in vision a New Jerusalem as
characteristic of the latter times.<a name="FNanchor_1042_1042" id="FNanchor_1042_1042"></a><a href="#Footnote_1042_1042" class="fnanchor">[1042]</a> Ether, writing 600 B.C.

establishment of the New Jerusalem on this continent, and emphasized
the distinction between that city and the Jerusalem of
old.</p>

<p><b>11.</b> The Nephite prophet, Moroni, in the synopsis of the
writings of Ether, says of the latter, that he saw concerning
the land of North America, "That it was the place of the
New Jerusalem, which should come down out of heaven,
and the Holy Sanctuary of the Lord." And adds: "Behold,
Ether saw the days of Christ, and he spake concerning
a new Jerusalem, upon this land; And he spake also
concerning the house of Israel, and the Jerusalem from
whence Lehi should come; after it should be destroyed, it
should be built up again a holy city unto the Lord, wherefore
it could not be a New Jerusalem, for it had been in a
time of old, but it should be built up again, and become a
holy city of the Lord; and it should be built unto the house
of Israel: And that a New Jerusalem should be built up
upon this land, unto the remnant of the seed of Joseph, for
which things there has been a type: For as Joseph brought
his father down into the land of Egypt, even so he died
there; wherefore the Lord brought a remnant of the seed of
Joseph out of the land of Jerusalem, that he might be merciful
unto the seed of Joseph, that they should perish not,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
even as he was merciful unto the father of Joseph, that he
should perish not; Wherefore the remnant of the house of
Joseph shall be built upon this land; and it shall be a land
of their inheritance; and they shall build up a holy city
unto the Lord, like unto the Jerusalem of old; and they
shall no more be confounded, until the end come, when the
earth shall pass away."<a name="FNanchor_1044_1044" id="FNanchor_1044_1044"></a><a href="#Footnote_1044_1044" class="fnanchor">[1044]</a></p>

<p><b>12.</b> Jesus Christ visited the Nephites in North America

were translated from the earth, or, as we read, "it came to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
pass that Zion was not, for God received it up into His own
bosom, and from thence went forth the saying, 'Zion is
fled.'"<a name="FNanchor_1051_1051" id="FNanchor_1051_1051"></a><a href="#Footnote_1051_1051" class="fnanchor">[1051]</a> But before this event, the Lord had revealed unto
Enoch the Divine purpose in regard to humanity, even unto
the last of time. Great events are to mark the latter days;
the elect are to be gathered from the four quarters of the
earth to a place prepared for them; the tabernacle of the
Lord is to be established there, and the place "shall be
called Zion, a New Jerusalem." Then Enoch and his people
are to return to earth and meet the gathered elect in the
holy place.</p>

<p><b>14.</b> We have seen that the names Zion and New Jerusalem
are used interchangeably; and, furthermore, that
righteous people as well as sanctified places are called Zion;
for, by the Lord's special word, Zion to Him means "the
pure in heart."<a name="FNanchor_1052_1052" id="FNanchor_1052_1052"></a><a href="#Footnote_1052_1052" class="fnanchor">[1052]</a> The Church in this day teaches that the
New Jerusalem seen by John, and by the prophet Ether,
as descending from the heavens in glory, is the return of
exalted Enoch and his righteous people; and that the people
or Zion of Enoch, and the modern Zion, or the gathered
elect on the western continent, will become one people.</p>

<p><b>15.</b> The Book of Mormon is explicit in foretelling the
establishment of Zion on the western continent; but the
precise location was not revealed until after the restoration
of the priesthood in the present dispensation. In 1831, the
Lord commanded the elders of His Church in this wise:&mdash;"Go
ye forth into the western countries, call upon the inhabitants
to repent, and inasmuch as they do repent, build
up churches unto me; and with one heart and with one mind,
gather up your riches that ye may purchase an inheritance
which shall hereafter be appointed unto you; and it shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
be called the New Jerusalem, a land of peace, a city of
refuge, a place of safety for the saints of the Most High
God; and the glory of the Lord shall be there, and the
terror of the Lord shall also be there, insomuch that the
wicked will not come unto it, and it shall be called Zion."<a name="FNanchor_1053_1053" id="FNanchor_1053_1053"></a><a href="#Footnote_1053_1053" class="fnanchor">[1053]</a></p>

<p><b>16.</b> Later revelations called the elders of the Church
to assemble in western Missouri,<a name="FNanchor_1054_1054" id="FNanchor_1054_1054"></a><a href="#Footnote_1054_1054" class="fnanchor">[1054]</a> and designated that place
as the land appointed and consecrated for the gathering of
the Saints.<a name="FNanchor_1055_1055" id="FNanchor_1055_1055"></a><a href="#Footnote_1055_1055" class="fnanchor">[1055]</a> "Wherefore this is the land of promise, and
the place for the city of Zion."<a name="FNanchor_1056_1056" id="FNanchor_1056_1056"></a><a href="#Footnote_1056_1056" class="fnanchor">[1056]</a> The town of Independence
was named as "the center place," and the site for the
temple was designated, the Saints being counseled to purchase
land there, "that they may obtain it for an everlasting
inheritance."<a name="FNanchor_1057_1057" id="FNanchor_1057_1057"></a><a href="#Footnote_1057_1057" class="fnanchor">[1057]</a> On August 3rd, 1831, the temple site
thus named was solemnly dedicated by the prophet, Joseph
Smith, and his associates in the priesthood.<a name="FNanchor_1058_1058" id="FNanchor_1058_1058"></a><a href="#Footnote_1058_1058" class="fnanchor">[1058]</a> The region
round about was also dedicated, that it might be a gathering
place for the people of God.</p>

<p><b>17.</b> Such, then, is the belief of the Latter-day Saints;
such are the teachings of the Church. But the plan of
building up Zion has not yet been consummated. The
Saints were not permitted to enter into immediate possession
of the land, which was promised them as an everlasting
inheritance. Even as years elapsed between the time of the
Lord's promise to Israel of old that Canaan should be their
inheritance, and the time of their entering into possession
thereof,&mdash;years devoted to the people's toilsome and sorrowful
preparation for the fulfilment,&mdash;so in these latter-days,
the Divine purpose is held in abeyance, while the people are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
being sanctified for the great gift, and for the greater
responsibilities associated with it. In the meantime, the
honest in heart are gathering to the valleys of the Rocky
Mountains; and here, in the tops of the mountains, exalted
above the hills, temples have been erected, and all nations
are flowing unto this region. But Zion shall yet be established
on the chosen site; she "shall not be moved out of
her place," and the pure in heart shall surely return,
"with songs of everlasting joy to build up the waste places
of Zion."<a name="FNanchor_1059_1059" id="FNanchor_1059_1059"></a><a href="#Footnote_1059_1059" class="fnanchor">[1059]</a></p>

<p><b>18.</b> But gathered Israel cannot be confined to the "center
place," nor to the region immediately adjacent; other
places have been and will be appointed, and these are called
Stakes of Zion.<a name="FNanchor_1060_1060" id="FNanchor_1060_1060"></a><a href="#Footnote_1060_1060" class="fnanchor">[1060]</a> Many stakes have been established in the
regions inhabited by the Latter-day Saints, and these are to
be permanent possessions; and thence will go those who are
appointed from among the worthy to receive possession of
their inheritances. Zion is to be chastened, but only for a
little season,<a name="FNanchor_1061_1061" id="FNanchor_1061_1061"></a><a href="#Footnote_1061_1061" class="fnanchor">[1061]</a> then will come the time of her redemption.</p>

<p><b>19.</b> That time will be appointed of God, yet it is to be
determined according to the faithfulness of the people.
Their wickedness causeth the Lord to tarry; for, saith He:&mdash;"Therefore,
in consequence of the transgression of my
people, it is expedient in me that mine elders should wait
for a little season for the redemption of Zion."<a name="FNanchor_1062_1062" id="FNanchor_1062_1062"></a><a href="#Footnote_1062_1062" class="fnanchor">[1062]</a> And
again,&mdash;"Zion shall be redeemed in mine own due time."<a name="FNanchor_1063_1063" id="FNanchor_1063_1063"></a><a href="#Footnote_1063_1063" class="fnanchor">[1063]</a>
But the Lord's time in giving blessings unto His people is
dependent upon them. As long ago as 1834 came the word
of the Lord unto the Church:&mdash;"Behold, I say unto you,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
were it not for the transgressions of my people ...
they might have been redeemed even now."<a name="FNanchor_1064_1064" id="FNanchor_1064_1064"></a><a href="#Footnote_1064_1064" class="fnanchor">[1064]</a></p>


<h3>NOTES.</h3>

<blockquote>

<p><b>1. Jerusalem.</b>&mdash;"The city has, in different ages, borne a variety of names, and
even in the Bible it has several designations. Salem, mentioned in Gen. xiv, 18, was
perhaps its name in the time of Melchizedek, and it is certainly so called in Psa. lxxvi,
2. Isaiah (xxix, 1, 7) calls it Ariel. Jebus, or Jebusi, the city of the Jebusites, was its
name in the days of Joshua and the Judges (Josh. xv, 8; xviii, 16, 28; Judges xix, 10,
11), and this name continued in use till David's time (I Chron. xi, 4, 5). Some have
thought that Jerusalem is itself a corruption of Jebus-Salem, but it is a theory unsupported
by facts. Jerusalem is also termed 'the city of David,' 'the city of Judah,' 'the
holy city,' 'the city of God' (II Kings xiv, 20; II Chron. xxv, 28; Neh. xi, 18; Psa.
lxxxvii, 3). To this day it is called el-Kuds, or 'the holy,' in most countries of the East.
No city in the world has received more honorable appellations; our Savior himself called
it 'the city of the great King.'"&mdash;<cite>Bible Dictionary</cite>, Cassell &amp; Co., p. 600.</p>

<p><b>2. The Founding of Zion in Missouri.</b>&mdash;"... A company of Saints
known as the Colesville Branch&mdash;from their having lived at Colesville, Broome County,
New York&mdash;had arrived in Missouri, and having received instructions to purchase the lands
in the regions around about Zion, they secured a tract of land in a fertile prairie some
ten or twelve miles west of Independence, in Kaw township, not far from the present
location of Kansas City. On the 2nd of August [1831]&mdash;the day preceding the dedication
of the temple site&mdash;in the settlement of the Colesville Saints, the first log was laid for a
house as the foundation of Zion. The log was carried by twelve men, in honor of the
Twelve Tribes of Israel; and Elder Sidney Rigdon consecrated and dedicated the land
of Zion for the gathering of the Saints."&mdash;<cite>Outlines of Ecclesiastical History</cite>, by Elder B.
H. Roberts, p. 352.</p>

<p><b>3. Temple Site, Independence, Jackson County, Missouri.</b>&mdash;"Taking the
road running west from the Court House for a scant half mile, you come to the summit
of a crowning hill, the slope of which to the south and west is quite abrupt, but very
gradual toward the north and east.... This is the temple site. It was upon
this spot on the third day of August, 1831, that Joseph Smith, Sidney Rigdon, Edward
Partridge, W. W. Phelps, Oliver Cowdery, Martin Harris, and Joseph Coe, and another
person whose name I cannot learn, for there were eight in all&mdash;men in whom the Lord was
well pleased, assembled to dedicate this place as the temple site in Zion. The eighty-seventh
psalm was read. Joseph [the prophet] then dedicated the spot, where is to be
built a temple on which the glory of God shall rest. Yea, the great God hath so decreed
it, saying: 'Verily this generation shall not pass away, until an house shall be built unto
the Lord, and a cloud shall rest upon it, which cloud shall be even the glory of the Lord,
which shall fill the house.... And the sons of Moses, and also the sons of
Aaron, shall offer an acceptable offering, and sacrifice in the house of the Lord, which
house shall be built unto the Lord in this generation, upon the consecrated spot as I have
appointed.'&mdash;(Doc. and Cov. sec. lxxxiv, 5, 31.)"&mdash;Elder B. H. Roberts, <cite>Missouri Persecutions</cite>.

<h2><a name="LECTURE_XX" id="LECTURE_XX">LECTURE XX.</a></h2>

<h3>CHRIST'S REIGN ON EARTH.</h3>

<blockquote>

<p><b>Article 10.</b>&mdash;We believe ... That Christ will reign personally upon the
earth, etc.</p></blockquote>


<p><b>1. Christ's First and Second Advents.</b>&mdash;The facts of
Christ's birth in the flesh, of His thirty and three years of
life among mortals, of His ministry, sufferings, and death,
are universally accepted as attested history. Not alone do
the records that the Christian world regards as sacred and
inspired bear testimony concerning these facts, but the
history written by man, and, in contrast, called profane, is
generally in harmony with the biblical account. Even those
who reject the doctrine of Christ's divinity, even they who
refuse to accept Him as their Redeemer, admit the historical
facts of His marvelous life, and acknowledge the incalculable
effect of His precepts and example upon the human
family.</p>

<p><b>2.</b> In the "Meridian of Time" Christ was born to earth,
amid humble surroundings,&mdash;in obscurity, indeed, to all
except the faithful few who had been watching for the
expected advent. His coming had been heralded through
the previous centuries, even from the dawn of human existence;
every prophet of God had borne record of the great
events which were to characterize His advent. Every important
incident connected with His birth, life, death, triumphal
resurrection, and ultimate glory as King, Lord, and God,
had been predicted; and even the details of the circumstances
were given with exactness. Judah and Israel had been
told to prepare for the coming of the Anointed One;<a name="FNanchor_1065_1065" id="FNanchor_1065_1065"></a><a href="#Footnote_1065_1065" class="fnanchor">[1065]</a> yet,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
behold, when He came to His own they received Him not.
Persecuted and despised, He trod the thorny path of duty,
"a, man of sorrows and acquainted with grief;" and, finally
condemned by His people, who clamored to an alien power for
authority to execute their own diabolical sentence upon their
Lord, He went to the death prescribed for malefactors.</p>

<p><b>3.</b> To human judgment, it surely seemed that the Divine
mission of Christ had been nullified, that His work had
failed, and that the powers of darkness had become triumphant.
Blind, deaf, and hard of heart were those who refused
to see, hear, and comprehend the purport of the
Savior's mission. Similarly benighted are they who reject
the prophetic evidence of His second coming, and who fail
to read the signs of the times, which declare the event, at
once so terrible and glorious, to be near at hand. Both before
and after His death, Christ prophesied of His appointed
reappearance upon the earth; and His faithful followers are
to-day waiting and watching for the signs of the great fulfillment.
The heavens are flaming with those signals, and
the burden of inspired teaching is again heard,&mdash;Repent,
repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.</p>

<p><b>4. Christ's Second Coming Predicted; and Signs Described.
Bible Prophecies.</b>&mdash;The prophets of the Old Testament, and
those of Book of Mormon record who lived and wrote before
the era of Christ, had little to say regarding the second
coming of the Lord, little indeed in comparison with their
numerous and explicit predictions concerning His first
advent. As they looked into the sky of futurity, and with
prophetic power read the story of the heavenly orbs, their
vision was dazzled with the brilliancy of the Meridian Sun,
and they saw little of the glorious luminary beyond, whose
proportions and radiance were veiled by the mists of distance.
A few of them saw and so testified, as the following
passages show: The Psalmist sang:&mdash;"Our God shall come,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
and shall not keep silence; a fire shall devour before him,
and it shall be very tempestuous round about him."<a name="FNanchor_1066_1066" id="FNanchor_1066_1066"></a><a href="#Footnote_1066_1066" class="fnanchor">[1066]</a> These
devouring and tempestuous conditions did not attend the
coming of Bethlehem's Babe.</p>

<p><b>5.</b> Isaiah cries:&mdash;"Say to them that are of a fearful
heart, Be strong, fear not; behold your God will come with
vengeance, even God with a recompense; he will come and
save you."<a name="FNanchor_1067_1067" id="FNanchor_1067_1067"></a><a href="#Footnote_1067_1067" class="fnanchor">[1067]</a> Aside from the evident fact that these conditions
did not attend the first coming of Christ, the context
of the prophet's words shows that he applied them to
the last days, the time of restitution, the day of the "ransomed
of the Lord," and of the triumph of Zion.<a name="FNanchor_1068_1068" id="FNanchor_1068_1068"></a><a href="#Footnote_1068_1068" class="fnanchor">[1068]</a> Again
Isaiah speaks:&mdash;"Behold, the Lord God will come with
strong hand, and his arm shall rule for him: behold, his
reward is with him, and his work before him."<a name="FNanchor_1069_1069" id="FNanchor_1069_1069"></a><a href="#Footnote_1069_1069" class="fnanchor">[1069]</a></p>

<p><b>6.</b> The prophet Enoch, who lived twenty centuries before
the first of those whose words are given above, spoke
with vigor on the subject. His teachings do not appear
under his own name in the Bible, though Jude, a New
Testament writer, cites them.<a name="FNanchor_1070_1070" id="FNanchor_1070_1070"></a><a href="#Footnote_1070_1070" class="fnanchor">[1070]</a> From the Book of Moses
in the Pearl of Great Price, we learn concerning the revelation
given to Enoch:&mdash;"And the Lord said unto Enoch, As
I live, even so will I come in the last days, in the days of
wickedness and vengeance, to fulfil the oath which I have
made unto you concerning the children of Noah."<a name="FNanchor_1071_1071" id="FNanchor_1071_1071"></a><a href="#Footnote_1071_1071" class="fnanchor">[1071]</a></p>

<p><b>7.</b> Jesus taught the disciples that His mission in the flesh
was to be of short duration, and that he would come again
to earth, for we find them enquiring in this wise, "Tell us
when shall these things be? And what shall be the sign of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
thy coming, and of the end of the world?"<a name="FNanchor_1072_1072" id="FNanchor_1072_1072"></a><a href="#Footnote_1072_1072" class="fnanchor">[1072]</a> In reply, our
Lord detailed many of the signs of the latter times, the last
and greatest of which He thus stated:&mdash;"And this gospel of
the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness
unto all nations; and then shall the end come."<a name="FNanchor_1073_1073" id="FNanchor_1073_1073"></a><a href="#Footnote_1073_1073" class="fnanchor">[1073]</a> With
great clearness, Jesus spoke of the worldliness in which the
children of men had continued to indulge, even on the eve
of the Deluge, and on the day of the fiery destruction which
befell the Cities of the Plains, and added:&mdash;"Even thus shall
it be in the day when the Son of man is revealed."<a name="FNanchor_1074_1074" id="FNanchor_1074_1074"></a><a href="#Footnote_1074_1074" class="fnanchor">[1074]</a></p>

<p><b>8.</b> Another of our Lord's predictions concerning His
second coming is as follows; His citation of the signs by
which the approach of the event may be known is so impressive
that we should read the description in its entirety:&mdash;"And
they [the disciples] asked him, saying, Master, but
when shall these things be? and what sign will there be
when these things shall come to pass? And he said, Take
heed that ye be not deceived: for many shall come in my
name, saying, I am Christ; and the time draweth near: go
ye not therefore after them. But when ye shall hear of
wars and commotions, be not terrified: for these things
must first come to pass; but the end is not by and by.
Then said he unto them, Nation shall rise against nation,
and kingdom against kingdom: and great earthquakes shall
be in divers places, and famines, and pestilences; and
fearful sights and great signs shall there be from heaven.
But before all these, they shall lay their hands on you,
and persecute you, delivering you up to the synagogues,
and into prisons, being brought before kings and rulers
for my name's sake. And it shall turn to you for a testimony.
Settle it therefore in your hearts, not to meditate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
before what ye shall answer: For I will give you a mouth
and wisdom, which all your adversaries shall not be able to
gainsay nor resist. And ye shall be betrayed both by
parents, and brethren, and kinsfolks, and friends; and some
of you shall they cause to be put to death. And ye shall be
hated of all men for my name's sake.... And there
shall be signs in the sun, and in the moon, and in the stars;
and upon the earth distress of nations, with perplexity; the
sea and the waves roaring; men's hearts failing them for
fear, and for looking after those things which are coming on
the earth: for the powers of heaven shall be shaken. And
then shall they see the Son of man coming in a cloud with
power and great glory. And when these things begin to
come to pass, then look up, and lift up your heads; for your
redemption draweth nigh."<a name="FNanchor_1075_1075" id="FNanchor_1075_1075"></a><a href="#Footnote_1075_1075" class="fnanchor">[1075]</a></p>

<p><b>9.</b> Again, by way of warning, the Lord said:&mdash;"Whosoever
therefore shall be ashamed of me and of my words, in
this adulterous and sinful generation, of him also shall the
Son of man be ashamed, when he cometh in the glory of his
Father with the holy angels."<a name="FNanchor_1076_1076" id="FNanchor_1076_1076"></a><a href="#Footnote_1076_1076" class="fnanchor">[1076]</a></p>

<p><b>10.</b> At the time of the Ascension, as the apostles stood
gazing into the firmament, where a cloud had hidden their
resurrected Lord from sight, they became aware of the
presence of two heavenly visitors, who said:&mdash;"Ye men of
Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven? this same
Jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so
come in like manner as ye have seen him go into heaven."<a name="FNanchor_1077_1077" id="FNanchor_1077_1077"></a><a href="#Footnote_1077_1077" class="fnanchor">[1077]</a>
Paul instructed the churches in the doctrines of Christ's
second advent, and described the glory of His coming.<a name="FNanchor_1078_1078" id="FNanchor_1078_1078"></a><a href="#Footnote_1078_1078" class="fnanchor">[1078]</a> So
also did others of the apostles.<a name="FNanchor_1079_1079" id="FNanchor_1079_1079"></a><a href="#Footnote_1079_1079" class="fnanchor">[1079]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span></p>

<p><b>11. Among Book of Mormon Prophecies</b> concerning our
present subject, we find the teachings of Christ Himself at
the time of His ministrations to the Nephites in His resurrected
state. To the multitude He explained many matters,
"even from the beginning until the time that He should
come in his glory."<a name="FNanchor_1080_1080" id="FNanchor_1080_1080"></a><a href="#Footnote_1080_1080" class="fnanchor">[1080]</a> In promising the three disciples the
desire of their hearts, which was that they might be spared
in the flesh to continue the work of the ministry, the Lord
said to them:&mdash;"Ye shall live to behold all the doings of
the Father, unto the children of men, even until all things
shall be fulfilled, according to the will of the Father, when
I shall come in my glory, with the powers of heaven."<a name="FNanchor_1081_1081" id="FNanchor_1081_1081"></a><a href="#Footnote_1081_1081" class="fnanchor">[1081]</a></p>

<p><b>12. The Word of Modern Revelation</b> is no less sure regarding
the appointed advent of the Redeemer. To servants,
specially commissioned, instructions were given to this
effect:&mdash;"Wherefore, be faithful, praying always, having
your lamps trimmed and burning, and oil with you,<a name="FNanchor_1082_1082" id="FNanchor_1082_1082"></a><a href="#Footnote_1082_1082" class="fnanchor">[1082]</a> that
you may be ready at the coming of the Bridegroom. For
behold, verily, verily, I say unto you that I come quickly."<a name="FNanchor_1083_1083" id="FNanchor_1083_1083"></a><a href="#Footnote_1083_1083" class="fnanchor">[1083]</a>
And again, this instruction is given:&mdash;"Cry repentance
unto a crooked and perverse generation, preparing the way
of the Lord for his second coming; for behold, verily, verily,
I say unto you, the time is soon at hand that I shall come in
a cloud with power and great glory."<a name="FNanchor_1084_1084" id="FNanchor_1084_1084"></a><a href="#Footnote_1084_1084" class="fnanchor">[1084]</a></p>

<p><b>13.</b> In a revelation to the people of the Church, March
7, 1831, the Lord speaks of the signs of His coming, and
counsels diligence. Consider His words:&mdash;"Ye look and
behold the fig-trees, and ye see them with your eyes, and ye
say when they begin to shoot forth, and their leaves are yet
tender, that summer is now nigh at hand; even so it shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
be in that day when they shall see all these things, then
shall they know that the hour is nigh. And it shall come to
pass that he that feareth me shall be looking forth for the
great day of the Lord to come, even for the signs of the
coming of the Son of man; and they shall see signs and
wonders, for they shall be shown forth in the heavens above,
and in the earth beneath; and they shall behold blood and
fire, and vapors of smoke; and before the day of the Lord
shall come, the sun shall be darkened, and the moon be
turned into blood, and stars fall from heaven; and the remnant
shall be gathered unto this place, and then they shall
look for me, and behold I will come; and they shall see me
in the clouds of heaven, clothed with power and great glory,
with all the holy angels; and he that watches not for me
shall be cut off."<a name="FNanchor_1085_1085" id="FNanchor_1085_1085"></a><a href="#Footnote_1085_1085" class="fnanchor">[1085]</a></p>

<p><b>14.</b> The distinctive characteristic of the revelations as
given in the present dispensation, regarding the second
coming of our Lord, is the emphatic and oft-repeated declaration
that the event is near at hand.<a name="FNanchor_1086_1086" id="FNanchor_1086_1086"></a><a href="#Footnote_1086_1086" class="fnanchor">[1086]</a> The call is, "Prepare
ye, prepare ye, for that which is to come, for the Lord
is nigh." Instead of the cry of one man in the wilderness
of Judea, the voice of thousands is heard authoritatively
warning the nations, and inviting them to repent and flee to
Zion for safety. The fig tree is rapidly putting forth its
leaves; the signs in heaven and earth are increasing; surely
the great and dreadful day of the Lord is near.</p>

<p><b>15. The Precise Time of Christ's Coming</b> has not been
made known to man. By learning to comprehend the signs
of the times, by watching the development of the work
of God among the nations, and by noting the rapid fulfillment
of significant prophecies, we may perceive the progressive
evidence of the approaching event, "But the hour and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>
the day no man knoweth, neither the angels in heaven, nor
shall they know until he comes."<a name="FNanchor_1087_1087" id="FNanchor_1087_1087"></a><a href="#Footnote_1087_1087" class="fnanchor">[1087]</a> His coming will be a
surprise to those who have rejected His warnings, and who
have failed to watch. "Like a thief in the night"<a name="FNanchor_1088_1088" id="FNanchor_1088_1088"></a><a href="#Footnote_1088_1088" class="fnanchor">[1088]</a> will
be the coming of the day of the Lord unto the wicked.
"Watch therefore, for ye know neither the day nor the hour
wherein the Son of man cometh."<a name="FNanchor_1089_1089" id="FNanchor_1089_1089"></a><a href="#Footnote_1089_1089" class="fnanchor">[1089]</a></p>

<p><b>16. Christ's Reign: The Kingdom.</b>&mdash;We have seen that,
according to the words of holy prophets ancient and modern,
Christ is to come, in a literal sense, and so manifest Himself
in person in the last days. He is to dwell among His Saints.
"Yea, even I will be in the midst of you,"<a name="FNanchor_1090_1090" id="FNanchor_1090_1090"></a><a href="#Footnote_1090_1090" class="fnanchor">[1090]</a> He declared to
the people on this continent, whom He promised to establish
in the land of the New Jerusalem; and similar assurances
were given through the prophets of the east.<a name="FNanchor_1091_1091" id="FNanchor_1091_1091"></a><a href="#Footnote_1091_1091" class="fnanchor">[1091]</a> In this
prospective ministration among His gathered Saints, Christ
is to be at once their God and their King. His government
is to be that of a perfect theocracy; the laws of righteousness
will be the code, and control will be administered under
one authority, undisputed because indisputable.</p>

<p><b>17.</b> The scriptures abound with declarations that the
Lord will yet reign among his people. To this effect sang
Moses before the hosts of Israel after their miraculous passage
through the Red Sea,&mdash;"The Lord shall reign for ever
and ever;"<a name="FNanchor_1092_1092" id="FNanchor_1092_1092"></a><a href="#Footnote_1092_1092" class="fnanchor">[1092]</a> and the psalmist echoes the refrain, "The Lord
is King for ever and ever."<a name="FNanchor_1093_1093" id="FNanchor_1093_1093"></a><a href="#Footnote_1093_1093" class="fnanchor">[1093]</a> Jeremiah calls Him "an everlasting
king," before whose wrath the earth shall tremble,
and the nations yield;<a name="FNanchor_1094_1094" id="FNanchor_1094_1094"></a><a href="#Footnote_1094_1094" class="fnanchor">[1094]</a> and Nebuchadnezzar, humbled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
through tribulation, rejoiced in honoring the King of
Heaven, "whose dominion is an everlasting dominion, and
his kingdom is from generation to generation."<a name="FNanchor_1095_1095" id="FNanchor_1095_1095"></a><a href="#Footnote_1095_1095" class="fnanchor">[1095]</a></p>

<p><b>18.</b> Even chosen Israel were not always willing to accept
God as their king. Remember how they protested that
Samuel, the anointed prophet and judge, was old,&mdash;a poor
excuse for their claim, as the old man ministered with vigor
among them for thirty-five years beyond that time,&mdash;and
how they cried for a king to rule them, that they might be
like other nations.<a name="FNanchor_1096_1096" id="FNanchor_1096_1096"></a><a href="#Footnote_1096_1096" class="fnanchor">[1096]</a> Note the pathetic words with which
the Lord replied to Samuel's prayer regarding this demand
of the people, and the sorrow with which He granted them
their wish:&mdash;"Hearken unto the voice of the people in
all that they say unto thee; for they have not rejected thee,
but they have rejected me that I should not reign over
them."<a name="FNanchor_1097_1097" id="FNanchor_1097_1097"></a><a href="#Footnote_1097_1097" class="fnanchor">[1097]</a> But the Lord will not be ever rejected by His
people; at the time appointed He will come with power and
great glory, and will assume His rightful place of authority
as King of earth.</p>

<p><b>19.</b> Daniel interpreted the dream of Nebuchadnezzar,
and spoke of the many kingdoms and divisions of kingdoms
which were to be established, then added:&mdash;"And in the
days of these kings shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom,
which shall never be destroyed: and the kingdom shall
not be left to other people, but it shall break in pieces and
consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand for ever."<a name="FNanchor_1098_1098" id="FNanchor_1098_1098"></a><a href="#Footnote_1098_1098" class="fnanchor">[1098]</a>
Touching the extent of the great kingdom to be established
the same prophet declared:&mdash;"And the kingdom and dominion,
and the greatness of the kingdom under the whole
heaven, shall be given to the people of the saints of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>
Most High, whose kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and
all dominions shall serve and obey him."<a name="FNanchor_1099_1099" id="FNanchor_1099_1099"></a><a href="#Footnote_1099_1099" class="fnanchor">[1099]</a></p>

<p><b>20.</b> Speaking of the restoration of Judah and Israel in
the last days, Micah prophesies:&mdash;"And the Lord shall
reign over them in mount Zion from henceforth, even for
ever."<a name="FNanchor_1100_1100" id="FNanchor_1100_1100"></a><a href="#Footnote_1100_1100" class="fnanchor">[1100]</a> In the annunciation to the Virgin, the angel said
of the unborn Christ:&mdash;"He shall reign over the house of
Jacob forever, and of his kingdom there shall be no end."<a name="FNanchor_1101_1101" id="FNanchor_1101_1101"></a><a href="#Footnote_1101_1101" class="fnanchor">[1101]</a>
In the visions of Patmos, the Apostle John saw the glorious
consummation, and a universal recognition of the eternal
King:&mdash;"And the seventh angel sounded; and there were
great voices in heaven, saying, The kingdoms of this world
are become the kingdoms of our Lord, and of his Christ;
and he shall reign forever and ever."<a name="FNanchor_1102_1102" id="FNanchor_1102_1102"></a><a href="#Footnote_1102_1102" class="fnanchor">[1102]</a> Modern revelation
is rich in evidence of an approaching reign of righteousness,
with Christ as King; witness the following:&mdash;"And
also the Lord shall have power over his saints, and shall
reign in their midst."<a name="FNanchor_1103_1103" id="FNanchor_1103_1103"></a><a href="#Footnote_1103_1103" class="fnanchor">[1103]</a> "For in my own due time will I
come upon the earth in judgment, and my people shall
be redeemed and shall reign with me on earth."<a name="FNanchor_1104_1104" id="FNanchor_1104_1104"></a><a href="#Footnote_1104_1104" class="fnanchor">[1104]</a></p>

<p><b>21. Kingdom and Church.</b>&mdash;In the Gospel according to
Matthew, the phrase "kingdom of heaven" is of frequent
occurrence; while in the books of the other evangelists, and
throughout the epistles, the expression is "kingdom of
God," "kingdom of Christ," or simply "kingdom." It is
evident that these expressions may be used interchangeably
without violence to the true meaning. However, the term
kingdom is used in more senses than one, and a careful study
of the context in each instance may be necessary to a proper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>
comprehension of the writers intent. The most common
usages are two:&mdash;1. An expression synonymous with "the
Church," having reference to the followers of Christ without
distinction as to their temporal or spiritual organizations.
2. The designation of the literal kingdom over which
Christ is to reign on earth in the last days.</p>

<p><b>22.</b> When we contemplate the Kingdom in the latter and
more general sense, the Church must be regarded as a part
thereof; an essential indeed, for it is the germ from which
the Kingdom is to be developed, and the very heart of the
perfected organization. The Church has existed and now
continues in an organized form, without the Kingdom as a
visibly established power with temporal authority in the
world; but the Kingdom cannot be maintained without the
Church.</p>

<p><b>23.</b> In modern revelation, the expressions "kingdom of
God" and "kingdom of heaven" are sometimes used with
distinctive meanings,&mdash;the former phrase signifying the
Church, and the latter the literal kingdom which is to
supersede and comprise all existing national divisions. In
this sense, the kingdom of God has been set up already in
these the last days; its beginning in and for the present
dispensation was the establishment of the Church on its
latter-day and permanent foundation. This is consistent
with our conception of the Church as the vital organ of
the Kingdom in general. The powers and authority committed
to the Church are then the keys of the Kingdom.
Such meaning is made clear in the following revelation to
the Church:&mdash;"The keys of the kingdom of God are committed
unto man on the earth, and from thence shall the
gospel roll forth unto the ends of the earth, as the stone
which is cut out of the mountain without hands<a name="FNanchor_1105_1105" id="FNanchor_1105_1105"></a><a href="#Footnote_1105_1105" class="fnanchor">[1105]</a> shall roll<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
forth, until it has filled the whole earth.... Call
upon the Lord, that his kingdom may go forth upon the
earth, that the inhabitants thereof may receive it, and be
prepared for the days to come, in the which the Son of man
shall come down in heaven, clothed in the brightness of his
glory, to meet the kingdom of God which is set up on the
earth; wherefore may the kingdom of God go forth, that
the kingdom of heaven may come, that thou, O God, mayest
be glorified in heaven, so on earth, that thy enemies may
be subdued; for thine is the honor, power and glory for
ever and ever."<a name="FNanchor_1106_1106" id="FNanchor_1106_1106"></a><a href="#Footnote_1106_1106" class="fnanchor">[1106]</a></p>

<p><b>24.</b> At the time of His glorious advent, Christ will be
accompanied by the hosts of righteous ones who have already
passed from earth; and the Saints who are still alive on
earth are to be quickened and caught up to meet Him, and
to descend with Him as partakers of His glory.<a name="FNanchor_1107_1107" id="FNanchor_1107_1107"></a><a href="#Footnote_1107_1107" class="fnanchor">[1107]</a> With Him
too will come Enoch and his band of the pure in heart;<a name="FNanchor_1108_1108" id="FNanchor_1108_1108"></a><a href="#Footnote_1108_1108" class="fnanchor">[1108]</a> and
a union will be effected with the Kingdom of God, or that
part of the Kingdom of Heaven previously established as the
Church of Christ on earth; and the Kingdom on earth will
be one with that in heaven. Then will be realized a complete
fulfillment of the Lord's own prayer, given as a pattern
to all who pray:&mdash;"Thy kingdom come, thy will be done in
earth, as it is in heaven."<a name="FNanchor_1109_1109" id="FNanchor_1109_1109"></a><a href="#Footnote_1109_1109" class="fnanchor">[1109]</a></p>

<p><b>25.</b> The disputed question, "Is the Kingdom already set
up on earth or are we to wait for its establishment until the
time of the future advent of Christ, the King?" may properly
receive answer either affirmative or negative, according
to the sense in which the term kingdom is understood. The
Kingdom of God as identical with the Church of Christ has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>
assuredly been established; its history is that of the Church
in these the last days; its officers are divinely commissioned,
their power is that of the holy priesthood. They claim an
authority which is spiritual, but also temporal in dealing
with the members of the organization,&mdash;Church or Kingdom
as you may choose to call it,&mdash;but they make no attempt, nor
do they assert the right, to modify, assail, or in any way
interfere with, existing governments; far less to subdue
nations or to set up rival systems of control. The Kingdom
of Heaven, including the Church, and comprising all nations,
will be set up with power and great glory when the
triumphant King comes with His heavenly retinue to personally
rule and reign on the earth which He has redeemed
at the sacrifice of His own life.</p>

<p><b>26.</b> As seen, the Kingdom of Heaven will comprise
more than the Church. The honorable and honest among
men will be accorded protection and the privileges of citizenship
under the perfect system of government which
Christ will administer; and this will be their happy lot
whether they are actually members of the Church or not.
Law-breakers and men of impure heart will meet the judgment
of destruction according to their sin; but those who
live according to the truth as they have been able to
receive and comprehend it, will enjoy the fullest liberty
under the benign influences of a perfect administration.
The special privileges and blessings associated with the
Church, the right to hold and exercise the priesthood with
its boundless possibilities and eternal powers, will be, as now
they are, for those only who enter into the covenant and become
part of the Church of the Redeemer.</p>

<p><b>27. The Millennium.</b>&mdash;In connection with scriptural mention
of Christ's reign on earth, a duration of a thousand
years is frequently specified. While we cannot regard this
as indicating a time limit to the Kingdom's existence, or a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>
measure of the Savior's administration of power, we are
justified in the belief that the thousand years immediately
following the establishment of the Kingdom are to be
specially characterized, so as to be different from both preceding
and succeeding time. The gathering of Israel and
the establishment of an earthly Zion are to be effected, preparatory
to His coming. His advent is to be marked by a
destruction of the wicked, and by the inauguration of an
era of peace. The Revelator saw the souls of the martyrs,
and of other righteous men, in power, living and reigning
with Christ a thousand years.<a name="FNanchor_1110_1110" id="FNanchor_1110_1110"></a><a href="#Footnote_1110_1110" class="fnanchor">[1110]</a> At the beginning of this
period Satan is to be bound, "that he should deceive the
nations no more until the thousand years should be fulfilled."<a name="FNanchor_1111_1111" id="FNanchor_1111_1111"></a><a href="#Footnote_1111_1111" class="fnanchor">[1111]</a>
Certain of the dead are not to live again until the
thousand years are passed;<a name="FNanchor_1112_1112" id="FNanchor_1112_1112"></a><a href="#Footnote_1112_1112" class="fnanchor">[1112]</a> while the righteous "shall be
priests of God and of Christ, and shall reign with him a
thousand years."<a name="FNanchor_1113_1113" id="FNanchor_1113_1113"></a><a href="#Footnote_1113_1113" class="fnanchor">[1113]</a> Among the most ancient of revelations
regarding the Millennium is that given to Enoch:&mdash;"And
it came to pass that Enoch saw the day of the coming of
the Son of Man, in the last days, to dwell on the earth in
righteousness for the space of a thousand years."<a name="FNanchor_1114_1114" id="FNanchor_1114_1114"></a><a href="#Footnote_1114_1114" class="fnanchor">[1114]</a></p>

<p><b>28.</b> It is evident, then, that in speaking of the Millennium
we have to consider a definite period, with important events
marking its beginning and its close, and conditions of unusual
blessedness extending throughout. It will be a sabbatical
era,<a name="FNanchor_1115_1115" id="FNanchor_1115_1115"></a><a href="#Footnote_1115_1115" class="fnanchor">[1115]</a>&mdash;a thousand years of peace. Enmity between man
and beast shall cease; the fierceness and venom of the brute
creation shall be done away,<a name="FNanchor_1116_1116" id="FNanchor_1116_1116"></a><a href="#Footnote_1116_1116" class="fnanchor">[1116]</a> and love shall rule.<a name="FNanchor_1117_1117" id="FNanchor_1117_1117"></a><a href="#Footnote_1117_1117" class="fnanchor">[1117]</a> A new<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span>
condition of affairs will prevail, as was declared in the word
of the Lord to Isaiah:&mdash;"For behold, I create new heavens
and a new earth; and the former shall not be remembered
nor come into mind."<a name="FNanchor_1118_1118" id="FNanchor_1118_1118"></a><a href="#Footnote_1118_1118" class="fnanchor">[1118]</a></p>

<p><b>29.</b> Concerning the state of peace, prosperity, and duration
of human life, characteristic of that period, we read:&mdash;"There
shall be no more thence an infant of days, nor an
old man that hath not filled his days: for the child shall die
an hundred years old; but the sinner being an hundred years
old shall be accursed. And they shall build houses, and
inhabit them; and they shall plant vineyards, and eat the
fruit of them. They shall not build, and another inhabit;
they shall not plant, and another eat: for as the days of a
tree are the days of my people, and mine elect shall long
enjoy the work of their hands. They shall not labor in
vain, nor bring forth for trouble; for they are the seed of
the blessed of the Lord, and their offspring with them.
And it shall come to pass, that before they call, I will
answer: and while they are yet speaking, I will hear. The
wolf and the lamb shall feed together, and the lion shall eat
straw like the bullock: and dust shall be the serpent's meat.
They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain,
saith the Lord."<a name="FNanchor_1119_1119" id="FNanchor_1119_1119"></a><a href="#Footnote_1119_1119" class="fnanchor">[1119]</a></p>

<p><b>30.</b> The Lord's voice is heard to-day declaring the same
prophetic truths, as is shown in the revelations touching
the Millennium given in the present dispensation of the
Church.<a name="FNanchor_1120_1120" id="FNanchor_1120_1120"></a><a href="#Footnote_1120_1120" class="fnanchor">[1120]</a> In 1831, the Lord addressed the elders of His
Church, and said:&mdash;"For the great Millennium, of which I
have spoken by the mouth of my servants, shall come; for
Satan shall be bound, and when he is loosed again, he shall
only reign for a little season, and then cometh the end of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>
the earth."<a name="FNanchor_1121_1121" id="FNanchor_1121_1121"></a><a href="#Footnote_1121_1121" class="fnanchor">[1121]</a> On another occasion these words were spoken:&mdash;"For
I will reveal myself from heaven with power and
great glory, with all the hosts thereof, and dwell in righteousness
with men on earth a thousand years, and the
wicked shall not stand.... And again, verily,
verity, I say unto you, that when the thousand years are
ended, and men again begin to deny their God, then will I
spare the earth but for a little season, and the end shall
come."<a name="FNanchor_1122_1122" id="FNanchor_1122_1122"></a><a href="#Footnote_1122_1122" class="fnanchor">[1122]</a></p>

<p><b>31.</b> The Millennium then is to precede the events usually
indicated by the scriptural phrase, "the end of the world."
During that period, all conditions will be propitious for
righteousness; Satan's power will be suspended; and men,
relieved to some extent from temptation, will be zealous in
the service of their reigning Lord. Nevertheless, sin will
not be wholly abolished, nor will death be banished;
though children will live to reach maturity in the flesh, and
then may be changed to a condition of immortality in the
"twinkling of an eye."<a name="FNanchor_1123_1123" id="FNanchor_1123_1123"></a><a href="#Footnote_1123_1123" class="fnanchor">[1123]</a> Both mortal and immortal beings
will tenant the earth, and communion with the heavenly
powers will be common. The Latter-day Saints believe that
during that millennial era they will be privileged to continue
the vicarious work for the dead, which constitutes so
important and so characteristic a feature of their duty,<a name="FNanchor_1124_1124" id="FNanchor_1124_1124"></a><a href="#Footnote_1124_1124" class="fnanchor">[1124]</a>
and that the facilities for direct communication with the
heavens will enable them to carry on their labor of love
without hindrance. When the thousand years are passed,
Satan will again assert his power, and those who are not
then numbered among the pure in heart will yield to his influence.
But the liberty thus recovered by "the prince of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span>
the power of the air"<a name="FNanchor_1125_1125" id="FNanchor_1125_1125"></a><a href="#Footnote_1125_1125" class="fnanchor">[1125]</a> will be of short duration; his final
doom will speedily follow, and with him will go to the punishment
that is everlasting, all who are his. Then the earth
will pass to its celestial condition, and become a fit abode for
the glorified sons and daughters of our God.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><b>1. "The Anointed One."</b>&mdash;"Christ, the official name of the Redeemer of
mankind, as Jesus, or in the Hebrew, <em>Joshua</em>, 'Savior,' was His natural name. Christ
means 'anointed,' from <em>chrio</em>, 'to anoint.' Under the Old Testament dispensation,
high priests, kings, and prophets were appointed to their office by the pouring of the
sacred oil upon their heads. The rite was performed by the recognized officer of Jehovah,
and was an outward testimony that their appointment proceeded direct from
God himself, as the source of all authority, and as being under the ancient covenant,
in a peculiar way, the governor of his people. The oil used in the consecration of
priests, and the anointing of the tabernacle and sacred vessels, was a special preparation
of myrrh, cinnamon, calamus, and cassia (Exo. xxx, 23-25), which the Jews were
forbidden to apply to the body, or to copy under pain of death. It was no doubt
intended to typify the gifts and graces of the Holy Spirit."&mdash;Cassell's <cite>Bible Dictionary</cite>,
p. 257.</p>

<p><b>2. The Seventh Thousand Years.</b>&mdash;"As each <em>seventh</em> year was Israel's
year of remission, so of the world's seven thousands, the seventh shall be its sabbatism."&mdash;Fausset's
<cite>Bible Cyclopedia</cite>, p. 685. "There remaineth therefore a rest to the
people of God"; or, as given by marginal reference, instead of "rest," the "keeping
of a sabbath."&mdash;Heb. iv, 9.</p>

<p><b>3. Millennial Peace.</b>&mdash;"The wolf also shall dwell with the lamb, and the
leopard shall lie down with the kid; and the calf and the young lion and the fatling
together; and a little child shall lead them. And the cow and the bear shall feed;
their young ones shall lie down together: and the lion shall eat straw like the ox.
And the sucking child shall play on the hole of the asp, and the weaned child shall
put his hand on the cockatrice' den. They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy
mountain: for the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord, as the waters
cover the sea."&mdash;Isa. xi, 6-9; see also lxv, 25.</p>

<p><b>4. The Earth before, during, and after the Millennium.</b>&mdash;"There
are three conditions of the earth spoken of in the inspired writings,&mdash;the present, in
which everything pertaining to it must go through a change which we call death; the
millennial condition, in which it will be sanctified for the residence of purer intelligences,
some mortal and some immortal; and the celestial condition, spoken of in
the twenty-first and twenty-second chapters of Revelation, which will be one of immortality
and eternal life."&mdash;<cite>Compendium</cite>, by Elders F. D. Richards and James A.

<p class="center">RENEWAL OF THE EARTH.</p>

<p><b>1. The Earth Under the Curse.</b>&mdash;The blessed conditions,
under which the earth shall exist and man shall live during
the millennial era, are almost beyond human powers of comprehension,
so different are they from all to which history
testifies and which experience confirms. A reign of righteousness
throughout the earth has never yet been known to
the fallen race of man. So marked has been the universal
curse, so great the power of the tempter; so bitter the selfish
and ungodly strife betwixt man and man, and between
nation and nation; so general has been the enmity of the
animal creation, among its own members, and toward the
being who, though in a degraded state, yet holds the Divine
commission to the authority of dominion; so prolific has
been the soil in bringing forth thorns, briers, and noxious
weeds, that the description of Eden is to us as the story of
another world, an orb of a higher order of existence, wholly
unlike this dreary sphere. Yet, we learn that Eden was
truly a feature of our planet, and that the earth is destined
to become a celestialized body,&mdash;fit for the abode of the
most exalted intelligences. The millennium, with all its
splendor, is but a more advanced stage of preparation, by
which the earth and its inhabitants will approach the fore-ordained
perfection.</p>

<p><b>2. Regeneration of the Earth.</b>&mdash;The term regeneration
(translated from the Greek <i lang="el" xml:lang="el">palingenesia</i>, and signifying a
new birth, or, more literally, one who is born again) occurs
twice<a name="FNanchor_1126_1126" id="FNanchor_1126_1126"></a><a href="#Footnote_1126_1126" class="fnanchor">[1126]</a> in the New Testament; while other expressions of
equivalent meaning are used in many places. However,
the terms are usually applied to the renewal of the soul of
man through the spiritual birth, by which salvation is made
obtainable; though our Lord's use of the term, in the
promise of future glory which He confirmed upon the
apostles, has probable reference to the rejuvenation of the
earth, its inhabitants and their institutions, in connection
with the millennial era:&mdash;"I say unto you, That ye which
have followed me, in the regeneration when the Son of man
shall sit in the throne of his glory, ye also shall sit upon
twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel."<a name="FNanchor_1127_1127" id="FNanchor_1127_1127"></a><a href="#Footnote_1127_1127" class="fnanchor">[1127]</a></p>

<p><b>3.</b> A time of restitution is foretold. Consider the words
of Peter, spoken to the people who had come together in
Solomon's porch, marveling over the miraculous healing of
the lame beggar at the gate Beautiful:&mdash;"Repent ye therefore,
and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out,
when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of
the Lord; and he shall send Jesus Christ, which before was
preached unto you: whom the heavens must receive until
the times of restitution of all things, which God hath spoken
by the mouth of all his holy prophets since the world
began."<a name="FNanchor_1128_1128" id="FNanchor_1128_1128"></a><a href="#Footnote_1128_1128" class="fnanchor">[1128]</a></p>

<p><b>4.</b> That the change to a state more nearly approaching
perfection is to affect both nature and man is evident from
the teachings of Paul, as recorded in his letter to the
Romans:&mdash;"Because the creature itself also shall be delivered
from the bondage of corruption into the glorious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span>
liberty of the children of God. For we know that the whole
creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now.
And not only they, but ourselves also, which have the first-fruits
of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves,
waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of our
body."<a name="FNanchor_1129_1129" id="FNanchor_1129_1129"></a><a href="#Footnote_1129_1129" class="fnanchor">[1129]</a></p>

<p><b>5.</b> This work of regeneration has already begun. As a
necessary preliminary, whereby the curse that would otherwise
afflict the earth might be averted, Elijah the
prophet was to visit the earth, bringing with him the
keys and authority of a great work; concerning which event,
while yet future, the Lord said:&mdash;"Behold, I will send you
Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and
dreadful day of the Lord: And he shall turn the heart of
the fathers to the children, and the heart of the children
to their fathers, lest I come and smite the earth with a
curse."<a name="FNanchor_1130_1130" id="FNanchor_1130_1130"></a><a href="#Footnote_1130_1130" class="fnanchor">[1130]</a></p>

<p><b>6.</b> The Latter-day Saints solemnly declare that this
prophecy has had a literal fulfillment, in that on the third
day of April, A.D. 1836, Elijah visited the Prophet Joseph
Smith and Oliver Cowdery, in the newly dedicated temple at
Kirtland, Ohio, announced his mission as that spoken of by
the mouth of Malachi, declared that the day for the fulfillment
of the prediction had come, and committed the keys of
this work of the last dispensation to the Church, that the
labor of restoration might be carried on; and moreover, as a
sign "that the great and dreadful day of the Lord is near,
even at the doors."<a name="FNanchor_1131_1131" id="FNanchor_1131_1131"></a><a href="#Footnote_1131_1131" class="fnanchor">[1131]</a> Throughout the Millennium, this
process of regeneration will be continued. Society shall
be purified; nations shall exist in peace; wars shall cease;
the ferocity of beasts shall be subdued; the earth, escaping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span>
in a great measure the curse of the Fall, shall yield bounteously
to the husbandman; and the planet shall be redeemed.</p>

<p><b>7.</b> The final stages of this regeneration of nature will
not be reached until the Millennium has run its blessed
course. Describing the events to take place after the completion
of the thousand years, John the Revelator says:&mdash;"And
I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first
heaven and the first earth were passed away; and there was
no more sea.... And I heard a great voice out of
heaven saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men,
and he will dwell with them, and they shall be his people,
and God himself shall be with them, and be their God.
And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and
there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying,
neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things
are passed away."<a name="FNanchor_1132_1132" id="FNanchor_1132_1132"></a><a href="#Footnote_1132_1132" class="fnanchor">[1132]</a> A similar prediction was made by
Ether the Jaredite, six hundred years before Christ was
born:&mdash;"And there shall be a new heaven, and a new earth:
and they shall be like unto the old, save the old have passed
away, and all things have become new."<a name="FNanchor_1133_1133" id="FNanchor_1133_1133"></a><a href="#Footnote_1133_1133" class="fnanchor">[1133]</a> This event is to
follow the scenes of the Millennium, as the context makes
plain.</p>

<p><b>8.</b> In the year 1830 of our present era, the Lord said:&mdash;"When
the thousand years are ended, and men again begin
to deny their God, then will I spare the earth but for a
little season; and the end shall come, and the heaven and
the earth shall be consumed and pass away, and there shall
be a new heaven and a new earth, for all old things shall
pass away, and all things shall become new, even the heaven
and the earth, and all the fulness thereof, both men and
beasts, the fowls of the air and the fishes of the sea: and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span>
not one hair, neither mote, shall be lost, for it is the workmanship
of mine hand."<a name="FNanchor_1134_1134" id="FNanchor_1134_1134"></a><a href="#Footnote_1134_1134" class="fnanchor">[1134]</a></p>

<p><b>9.</b> According to the scriptures, the earth has to undergo
a change analogous to death, and to be regenerated in a
manner comparable to a resurrection. References to the
elements melting with heat, and to the earth being consumed
and passing away, such as occur in many scriptures
already cited, are suggestive of death; and the new earth,
really the renewed or regenerated planet, which is to result,
may be compared with a resurrected organism. The
change has been likened unto a transfiguration.<a name="FNanchor_1135_1135" id="FNanchor_1135_1135"></a><a href="#Footnote_1135_1135" class="fnanchor">[1135]</a> Every
created thing has been made for a purpose; and everything
that fills the measure of its creation is to be advanced in
the scale of progression, be it an atom or a world, an
animalcule, or man&mdash;the direct and literal offspring of
Deity. In speaking of the degrees of glory provided for
His creations, and of the laws of regeneration and sanctification,
the Lord, in a revelation dated 1832, speaks
plainly of the approaching death and subsequent quickening
of the earth. These are His words:&mdash;"And again,
verily, I say unto you, the earth abideth the law of a celestial
kingdom, for it filleth the measure of its creation, and
transgresseth not the law. Wherefore it shall be sanctified;
yea, notwithstanding it shall die, it shall be quickened again,
and shall abide the power by which it is quickened, and the
righteous shall inherit it."<a name="FNanchor_1136_1136" id="FNanchor_1136_1136"></a><a href="#Footnote_1136_1136" class="fnanchor">[1136]</a></p>

<p><b>10.</b> During the Millennium, the earth, while preparing
for the final change, will be tenanted by both mortal and
immortal beings; but after the regeneration is complete,
death will no longer be known among its inhabitants. Then
the Redeemer of earth "shall deliver up the kingdom, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span>
present it unto the Father spotless, saying, I have overcome."<a name="FNanchor_1137_1137" id="FNanchor_1137_1137"></a><a href="#Footnote_1137_1137" class="fnanchor">[1137]</a>
Before victory is thus achieved and triumph won,
the enemies of righteousness must be subdued; the last foe
to be vanquished is death. Thus saith Paul the Apostle:&mdash;"Then
cometh the end, when he shall have delivered up the
kingdom to God, even the Father; when he shall have put
down all rule, and all authority and power. For he must
reign, till he hath put all enemies under his feet. The last
enemy that shall be destroyed is death. For he hath put all
things under his feet. But when he saith, All things are put
under him, it is manifest that he is excepted, which did put
all things under him. And when all things shall be subdued
unto him, then shall the Son also himself be subject unto
him that put all things under him, that God may be all in
all."<a name="FNanchor_1138_1138" id="FNanchor_1138_1138"></a><a href="#Footnote_1138_1138" class="fnanchor">[1138]</a></p>

<p><b>11.</b> The following partial description of the earth in its
immortalized condition has been given by the Prophet
Joseph Smith in this dispensation:&mdash;"This earth, in its
sanctified and immortal state, will be made like unto crystal,
and will be a Urim and Thummim<a name="FNanchor_1139_1139" id="FNanchor_1139_1139"></a><a href="#Footnote_1139_1139" class="fnanchor">[1139]</a> to the inhabitants who
dwell thereon, whereby all things pertaining to an inferior
kingdom, or all kingdoms of a lower order, will be manifest
to those who dwell on it; and this earth will be Christ's."<a name="FNanchor_1140_1140" id="FNanchor_1140_1140"></a><a href="#Footnote_1140_1140" class="fnanchor">[1140]</a></p>

<p><b>12. Absence of Evidence from Science.</b>&mdash;Attempts have
been made to demonstrate an agreement between the teachings
of science concerning the destiny of the earth, and the
scriptural predictions regarding the ordained regeneration
of our planet, by which it is to be made fit for the abode of
immortal souls. Without considering the details of the alleged
evidence of mutual support between science and the
revealed word in this matter, it may suffice to say that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span>
so-called evidence is unsatisfactory, and that science is practically
silent on the subject. The geologist views the earth
as a body in process of continual change, its surface a
heterogeneous mass of fragmental material; he reads, in the
record inscribed on its stony pages, the story of past development
through many successive stages of progress, each
making the globe more fit for habitation by man; he witnesses
the work of constructive and destructive agencies now
in operation, land masses yielding to the lowering action of
air and water, and by their destruction furnishing material
for other formations now in process of construction;&mdash;the
general effect of all such being to level the surface by degrading
the hills and raising the valleys. On the other
hand, he observes volcanic agencies operating to increase the
inequality of level by violent eruption and crustal elevation.
He confesses inability, from his observations of the present,
and his deductions concerning the past of the earth, to predict
even a probable future. So futile have been his efforts
to ascertain the origin or determine the destiny of the globe,
that he has generally abandoned the attempt. The epoch-making
declaration of an acknowledged leader in the science
has now become proverbial:&mdash;Geology furnishes "no traces
of a beginning, no prospect of an end."<a name="FNanchor_1141_1141" id="FNanchor_1141_1141"></a><a href="#Footnote_1141_1141" class="fnanchor">[1141]</a></p>

<p><b>13.</b> The astronomer, studying the varied conditions of
other worlds, may seek by analogy to learn of the probable
fate of our own. Gazing into space with greatly augmented
vision, he sees, within the system to which the earth belongs,
spheres exhibiting a great range of development,&mdash;some in
their formative stage, seemingly unfit for the abode of beings
constituted as are we; others in a state more nearly resembling
that of the earth: and yet others seemingly old and
lifeless. Of the mighty systems beyond the comparatively
small company under control of our own sun, he knows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span>
nothing but the existence of these central orbs. But,
nowhere has he discovered a celestialized world. Think you
that mortal eye could discern such even if it were within
the limits of vision as determined by distance alone?</p>

<p><b>14.</b> The poet has written:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="line">"Nor think though men were not,</div>
<div class="line">That heaven would want spectators,</div>
<div class="line">God want praise!</div>
<div class="line">Millions of spiritual beings</div>
<div class="line">Walk the earth</div>
<div class="line">Unseen both when we wake,</div>
<div class="line">And when we sleep."</div>
</div></div>

<p>If this thought be founded on truth, and the Christian
soul will hardly doubt it, we may as readily believe in the
existence of other worlds than those of structure so gross as
to be visible to our dull eyes. I repeat, that in regard to
the revealed word concerning the regeneration of earth,
and the acquirement of a celestial glory by our planet,
science has nothing to offer, either by way of support or contradiction.
Let us not because of this, disparage science,
or decry the labors of its votaries. No one realizes more
fully than does the truly scientific man how much we do
not know.</p>


<p class="center">RESURRECTION OF THE BODY.</p>

<p><b>15. The Resurrection from the Dead.</b>&mdash;Closely associated
with, and analogous to, the ordained rejuvenation of earth,
whereby our planet is to pass from its present dreary and
broken state to a condition of glorified perfection, is the
resurrection of the bodies of all beings who have had an
existence upon its surface. The Church of Jesus Christ of
Latter-day Saints teaches the doctrine of a literal resurrection;
an actual re-union of departed spirits and the tabernacles
with which they were clothed during mortal probation;
and a transition from mortality to immortality in the
case of some who will be in the flesh at the time of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span>
great change, and who, because of individual righteousness,
are to be spared the sleep of the grave. But in such
teachings, the Church is not essentially different from most
Christian sects, except perhaps in the literalness of the
bodily resurrection as taught by it, and in the belief concerning
the nature of the resurrected state. The Bible is
replete with evidence regarding the quickening of the
dead. Human knowledge of the resurrection rests wholly
upon revelation. Pagan peoples have therefore no conception
of an actual coming forth of the dead unto life.<a name="FNanchor_1142_1142" id="FNanchor_1142_1142"></a><a href="#Footnote_1142_1142" class="fnanchor">[1142]</a></p>

<p><b>16.</b> In accepting the doctrine of a resurrection, we are
to be guided by faith; which, however, is supported by
abundant revelation, given in a manner unequivocal and
sure. Science, the result of human research, fails to
afford us any indication of such an event in the history
of living things, and men have sought in vain for an
analogy in external nature. True, comparisons have been
made, metaphors have been employed, and similes pressed
into service, to show in nature some counterpart or semblance
of the immortalizing change to which the Christian
soul looks forward with unwavering confidence; but all
such figures of speech are defective in the application, and
untrue in their professed analogies.</p>

<p><b>17.</b> The return of spring after the death-like sleep of
winter; the passing of the crawling caterpillar into the
corpse-like chrysalis, and the subsequent emergence of the
winged butterfly; the coming forth of a living bird from
the tomb-like recess of the egg; these and other natural
processes of development have been used as illustrative of
the resurrection. Each of them is defective, for in no
instance of such awakening has there been an actual death.
If the tree die, it will not resume its leafage with the return
of the sun; if the pupa within the chrysalis, or the life-germ<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span>
within the egg be killed, no butterfly or bird will
emerge. When we indulge such figurative illustrations
without most thorough caution, we are apt to conceive the
thought that the body predestined to resurrection is not
truly dead; and that therefore the quickening which is to
follow, is not what the revealed word declares it to be.
Observation proves that the separation of the spirit from
the body leaves the latter an inanimate mass, no longer able
to resist the processes of physical and chemical dissolution.
The body, deserted by its immortal tenant, is literally dead;
it resolves itself into its natural components, and its substance
enters again upon the round of universal circulation
of matter. Yet the resurrection from the dead is
assured; the faith of those who trust in the word of revealed
truth will be vindicated,<a name="FNanchor_1143_1143" id="FNanchor_1143_1143"></a><a href="#Footnote_1143_1143" class="fnanchor">[1143]</a> and the Divine decree will
be carried into full effect.</p>

<p><b>18. Predictions concerning the Resurrection.</b>&mdash;The prophets
in the past dispensations of the world's history have
foreseen and foretold the final conquest of death. Some
of them testified specifically of Christ's victory over the
tomb; others have dwelt upon the resurrection in a general
way. Job, the man of patience under tribulation, sang
joyously even in his agony:&mdash;"For I know that my Redeemer
liveth, and that he shall stand at the latter day
upon the earth: and though after my skin worms destroy
this body, yet in my flesh shall I see God."<a name="FNanchor_1144_1144" id="FNanchor_1144_1144"></a><a href="#Footnote_1144_1144" class="fnanchor">[1144]</a> Enoch, to
whom the Lord revealed His plan for the redemption of
mankind, foresaw the resurrection of Christ, the coming
forth of the righteous dead with Him, and the eventual
resurrection of all men.<a name="FNanchor_1145_1145" id="FNanchor_1145_1145"></a><a href="#Footnote_1145_1145" class="fnanchor">[1145]</a></p>

<p><b>19.</b> Nephi testified to his brethren that the Redeemer's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span>
death was a fore-ordained necessity, provided in order that
resurrection from the dead might be given to man. These
are his words:&mdash;"For as death hath passed upon all men, to
fulfil the merciful plan of the great Creator there must
needs be a power of resurrection, and the resurrection
must needs come unto man by reason of the fall; and the
fall came by reason of transgression; and because man became
fallen they were cut off from the presence of the Lord;
... And this death of which I have spoken, which
is the spiritual death, shall deliver up its dead; which
spiritual death is hell; wherefore, death and hell must
deliver up their dead, and hell must deliver up its
captive spirits, and the grave must deliver up its captive
bodies, and the bodies and the spirits of men will be
restored one to the other; and it is by the power of
the resurrection of the Holy One of Israel. O how great
the plan of our God! For on the other hand, the paradise
of God must deliver up the spirits of the righteous, and
the grave deliver up the body of the righteous; and the
spirit and the body is restored to itself again, and all men
become incorruptible, and immortal, and they are living
souls, having a perfect knowledge like unto us in the flesh;
save it be that our knowledge shall be perfect."<a name="FNanchor_1146_1146" id="FNanchor_1146_1146"></a><a href="#Footnote_1146_1146" class="fnanchor">[1146]</a></p>

<p><b>20.</b> Samuel, the Lamanite prophet, predicted the Savior's
birth, ministry, death, and resurrection, and explained the
resulting resurrection of mankind:&mdash;"For behold, he surely
must die, that salvation may come; yea, it behoveth him, and
becometh expedient that he dieth, to bring to pass the resurrection
of the dead, that thereby men may be brought into
the presence of the Lord; Yea, behold this death bringeth
to pass the resurrection, and redeemeth all mankind from
the first death&mdash;that spiritual death; for all mankind, by
the fall of Adam, being cut off from the presence of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span>
Lord, are considered as dead, both as to things temporal and
to things spiritual. But, behold, the resurrection of Christ
redeemeth mankind, yea, even all mankind, and bringeth
them back into the presence of the Lord."<a name="FNanchor_1147_1147" id="FNanchor_1147_1147"></a><a href="#Footnote_1147_1147" class="fnanchor">[1147]</a></p>

<p><b>21.</b> The New Testament furnishes abundant evidence
that the doctrine of the resurrection was very generally
understood during the time of Christ's earthly mission, and
in the succeeding apostolic era.<a name="FNanchor_1148_1148" id="FNanchor_1148_1148"></a><a href="#Footnote_1148_1148" class="fnanchor">[1148]</a> The Master Himself proclaimed
these teachings. In reply to the hypercritical Sadducees,<a name="FNanchor_1149_1149" id="FNanchor_1149_1149"></a><a href="#Footnote_1149_1149" class="fnanchor">[1149]</a>
He said:&mdash;"But as touching the resurrection of the
dead, have ye not read that which was spoken unto you by
God, saying, I am the God of Abraham, and the God of
Isaac, and the God of Jacob? God is not the God of the
dead, but of the living."<a name="FNanchor_1150_1150" id="FNanchor_1150_1150"></a><a href="#Footnote_1150_1150" class="fnanchor">[1150]</a> the Jews who sought His
life because of His deeds and doctrine He spoke in this
way:&mdash;"Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my
word, and believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting
life, and shall not come into condemnation; but is passed
from death unto life. Verily, verily, I say unto you, The
hour is coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear the
voice of the Son of God: and they that hear shall live."<a name="FNanchor_1151_1151" id="FNanchor_1151_1151"></a><a href="#Footnote_1151_1151" class="fnanchor">[1151]</a></p>

<p><b>22.</b> That Christ fully comprehended the purpose of His
approaching martyrdom, and the resurrection which was to
follow, is abundantly proved by His own utterances while
yet in the flesh. To Nicodemus He said:&mdash;"And as Moses
lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the
Son of man be lifted up: That whosoever believeth in him
should not perish, but have eternal life."<a name="FNanchor_1152_1152" id="FNanchor_1152_1152"></a><a href="#Footnote_1152_1152" class="fnanchor">[1152]</a> And to Martha,

in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live."<a name="FNanchor_1153_1153" id="FNanchor_1153_1153"></a><a href="#Footnote_1153_1153" class="fnanchor">[1153]</a> Of

<p><b>23. Two General Resurrections</b> are mentioned in the scriptures:
these may be specified as first and final, or as the
resurrection of the just and the resurrection of the unjust.
The first was inaugurated by the resurrection of Jesus Christ;
immediately following which, many of the departed Saints
came forth from their graves; a continuation of this, the
resurrection of the just, has been in operation,<a name="FNanchor_1155_1155" id="FNanchor_1155_1155"></a><a href="#Footnote_1155_1155" class="fnanchor">[1155]</a> and will be
brought to pass in a general way in connection with the
coming of Christ in His glory, and will be incident therefore
to the beginning of the Millennium. The final resurrection

<p><b>24. The First Resurrection.&mdash;Christ's Resurrection, and
that immediately following.</b>&mdash;The facts of Christ's resurrection
from the dead are attested by such an array of scriptural
proofs that no doubt of the reality finds place in the
mind of any believer in the inspired records. To the women
who came early to the sepulchre, the angel, who had rolled
the stone from the door of the tomb, spoke, saying:&mdash;"He
is not here, for he is risen, as he said."<a name="FNanchor_1156_1156" id="FNanchor_1156_1156"></a><a href="#Footnote_1156_1156" class="fnanchor">[1156]</a> Afterward the

not to testify of the genuineness of their Lord's resurrection,
nor did they fail to proclaim the resurrections of the future.</p>

<p><b>25.</b> Christ, "the first-fruits of them that slept,"<a name="FNanchor_1160_1160" id="FNanchor_1160_1160"></a><a href="#Footnote_1160_1160" class="fnanchor">[1160]</a> was the
first among men to come forth from the grave in an immortalized
body; but we read that, soon after His resurrection,
many of the Saints were brought from their tombs:&mdash;"And
the graves were opened; and many bodies of the
saints which slept arose, and came out of the graves after
his resurrection, and went into the holy city, and appeared
unto many."<a name="FNanchor_1161_1161" id="FNanchor_1161_1161"></a><a href="#Footnote_1161_1161" class="fnanchor">[1161]</a></p>

<p><b>26.</b> Alma, the Nephite prophet, whose writings antedate
by nearly a century the birth of Christ, clearly understood
that there would be no resurrection prior to that of the
Redeemer, for he said:&mdash;"Behold I say unto you, that there
is no resurrection; or, I would say, in other words, that this
mortal does not put on immortality; this corruption does
not put on incorruption, until after the coming of Christ."<a name="FNanchor_1162_1162" id="FNanchor_1162_1162"></a><a href="#Footnote_1162_1162" class="fnanchor">[1162]</a>
And furthermore, he foresaw a general resurrection in connection
with Christ's coming forth from the dead, as the
context of the foregoing quotation clearly proves.<a name="FNanchor_1163_1163" id="FNanchor_1163_1163"></a><a href="#Footnote_1163_1163" class="fnanchor">[1163]</a> Inspired

Himself, declaring the facts of His death and resurrection:&mdash;"For

men might repent and come unto him. And he hath risen
again from the dead, that he might bring all men unto him

<p><b>28. Resurrection at the Time of Christ's Second Coming.</b>&mdash;Immediately,
after the departure of Christ from the earth,
the apostles, upon whom then devolved the direct responsibility
of the Church, were found preaching the doctrine of
a future and universal resurrection. This teaching appears
to have formed a very prominent feature of their instructions;
for it was made a special cause of complaint by
the Sadducees, who assailed the apostles, even within the
sacred confines of the temple, the accusers "being grieved
that they [the apostles] taught the people, and preached
through Jesus the resurrection from the dead."<a name="FNanchor_1168_1168" id="FNanchor_1168_1168"></a><a href="#Footnote_1168_1168" class="fnanchor">[1168]</a> Paul
gave offense by the zeal with which he preached the resurrection
which was to come; as witness his contention with
certain philosophers of the Epicureans and of the Stoics;
in the course of which some said:&mdash;"What will this babbler
say? other some, He seemeth to be a setter forth of strange
gods: because he preached unto them Jesus, and the resurrection."<a name="FNanchor_1169_1169" id="FNanchor_1169_1169"></a><a href="#Footnote_1169_1169" class="fnanchor">[1169]</a>
The discussion was continued at Areopagus, or
Mars' Hill, where Paul preached the gospel of the true and
living God, including the tenets of the resurrection. "And
when they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some
mocked; and others said, We will hear thee again of this
matter."<a name="FNanchor_1170_1170" id="FNanchor_1170_1170"></a><a href="#Footnote_1170_1170" class="fnanchor">[1170]</a> He declared the same truth to Felix, the governor
of Judea;<a name="FNanchor_1171_1171" id="FNanchor_1171_1171"></a><a href="#Footnote_1171_1171" class="fnanchor">[1171]</a> and when brought in bonds before Agrippa, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span>
king, he asked, as if dealing with one of the principal accusations
against him, "Why should it be thought a thing
incredible with you, that God should raise the dead?"<a name="FNanchor_1172_1172" id="FNanchor_1172_1172"></a><a href="#Footnote_1172_1172" class="fnanchor">[1172]</a></p>

<p><b>29.</b> The resurrection appears to have been a favorite
theme with Paul; in his epistles to the Saints, he gives it a
prominent place.<a name="FNanchor_1173_1173" id="FNanchor_1173_1173"></a><a href="#Footnote_1173_1173" class="fnanchor">[1173]</a> From him, also, we learn that an order
of precedence is to be observed in the resurrection:&mdash;"But
now is Christ risen from the dead, and become the first-fruits
of them that slept. For since by man came death, by
man came also the resurrection of the dead. For as in
Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive. But
every man in his own order: Christ the first-fruits; afterward
they that are Christ's at his coming."<a name="FNanchor_1174_1174" id="FNanchor_1174_1174"></a><a href="#Footnote_1174_1174" class="fnanchor">[1174]</a></p>

<p><b>30.</b> It is expressly declared that many graves shall yield
up their dead at the time of Christ's advent in glory, and
the just who have slept, together with many who have not
died, will be caught up to meet the Lord. Paul thus wrote
to the Saints in Thessalonica:&mdash;"Even so them also which
sleep in Jesus will God bring with him.... For the
Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with
the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and
the dead in Christ shall rise first. Then we which are alive
and remain shall be caught up together with them in the
clouds to meet the Lord in the air."<a name="FNanchor_1175_1175" id="FNanchor_1175_1175"></a><a href="#Footnote_1175_1175" class="fnanchor">[1175]</a></p>

<p><b>31.</b> To the three Nephite disciples, who had asked the
blessing of John the beloved apostle, Christ said:&mdash;"And ye
shall never endure the pains of death; but when I shall
come in my glory, ye shall be changed in the twinkling of
an eye from mortality to immortality."<a name="FNanchor_1176_1176" id="FNanchor_1176_1176"></a><a href="#Footnote_1176_1176" class="fnanchor">[1176]</a></p>

<p><b>32.</b> Through the medium of latter-day revelation, the
Lord has said:&mdash;"Behold I will come, and they shall see me
in the clouds of heaven, clothed with power and great glory,
with all the holy angels; and he that watches not for me
shall be cut off. But before the arm of the Lord shall fall,
an angel shall sound his trump, and the Saints that have
slept shall come forth to meet me in the cloud."<a name="FNanchor_1177_1177" id="FNanchor_1177_1177"></a><a href="#Footnote_1177_1177" class="fnanchor">[1177]</a> Of the

that are upon the earth, who are alive, shall be quickened,
and be caught up to meet him. And they who have slept
in their graves shall come forth; for their graves shall be
opened, and they also shall be caught up to meet him in the
midst of the pillar of heaven. They are Christ's, the first-fruits;
they who shall descend with him first, and they who
are on the earth and in their graves, who are first caught up
to meet him."<a name="FNanchor_1178_1178" id="FNanchor_1178_1178"></a><a href="#Footnote_1178_1178" class="fnanchor">[1178]</a></p>

<p><b>33.</b> Such are some of the glories to attend the first
resurrection; in which only the righteous are to have part.
But the company of the righteous will include all who
have faithfully lived according to the laws of God as made
known to them; children who have died in their innocence;
and even the just among the heathen nations who have
lived in comparative darkness while groping for light, and
who have died in ignorance.<a name="FNanchor_1179_1179" id="FNanchor_1179_1179"></a><a href="#Footnote_1179_1179" class="fnanchor">[1179]</a> This doctrine is made plain

the power of death; and of this company of the redeemed
it is written:&mdash;"Blessed and holy is he that hath part in the
first resurrection; on such the second death hath no power,
but they shall be priests of God and of Christ, and shall
reign with him a thousand years."<a name="FNanchor_1181_1181" id="FNanchor_1181_1181"></a><a href="#Footnote_1181_1181" class="fnanchor">[1181]</a></p>

<p><b>34. The Final Resurrection.</b>&mdash;"But the rest of the dead

So said the Revelator after having described the glorious
blessings of the just, who are given part in the first resurrection.
The unworthy will be called to the judgment of
condemnation, when the regenerated world is ready to be
presented to the Father.<a name="FNanchor_1183_1183" id="FNanchor_1183_1183"></a><a href="#Footnote_1183_1183" class="fnanchor">[1183]</a></p>

<p><b>35.</b> The contrast between those whose part in the first
resurrection is assured, and those whose doom it is to wait
until the time of final judgment, is a strong one, and in no
case do the scriptures lighten it. We are told that it is
proper for us to weep over bereavement by death, "and
more especially for those that have not hope of a glorious
resurrection."<a name="FNanchor_1184_1184" id="FNanchor_1184_1184"></a><a href="#Footnote_1184_1184" class="fnanchor">[1184]</a> In the present day, the voice of the Mighty
One is heard in solemn warning:&mdash;"Hearken ye, for, behold,
the great day of the Lord is nigh at hand. For the day
cometh that the Lord shall utter his voice out of heaven; the
heavens shall shake, and the earth shall tremble, and the
trump of God shall sound both long and loud, and shall say
to the sleeping nations, Ye saints arise and live; ye sinners
stay and sleep until I shall call again."<a name="FNanchor_1185_1185" id="FNanchor_1185_1185"></a><a href="#Footnote_1185_1185" class="fnanchor">[1185]</a></p>

<p><b>36.</b> The vision of the final scene is thus described by
John:&mdash;"And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before
God; and the books were opened; and another book was
opened, which is the book of life; and the dead were judged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[402]</a></span>
out of those things which were written in the books, according
to their works. And the sea gave up the dead which
were in it; and death and hell delivered up the dead which
were in them: and they were judged every man according
to their works."<a name="FNanchor_1186_1186" id="FNanchor_1186_1186"></a><a href="#Footnote_1186_1186" class="fnanchor">[1186]</a> This stage marks the completion of
the work of resurrection. As the scriptures conclusively
prove, the resurrection will be universal; while it is true
that the dead will be brought forth in order, each as he is
prepared for the first or the final stage, yet everyone who
has tabernacled in the flesh will again assume his body and
with such be judged.</p>

<p><b>37.</b> The Book of Mormon is explicit in the description of
the literal and universal resurrection:&mdash;"Now, there is a
death which is called a temporal death; and the death of
Christ shall loose the bands of this temporal death, that all
shall be raised from this temporal death; The spirit and the
body shall be re-united again in its perfect form; both limb
and joint shall be restored to its proper frame, even
as we now are at this time, and we shall be brought to stand
before God, knowing even as we know now, and have a
bright recollection of all our guilt. Now this restoration
shall come to all, both old and young, both bond and free,
both male and female, both the wicked and the righteous;
and even there shall not so much as a hair of their heads be
lost; but all things shall be restored to its perfect frame, as
it is now, or in the body, and shall be brought and be
arraigned before the bar of Christ the Son, and God the
Father, and the Holy Spirit, which is one eternal God, to be
judged according to their works, whether they be good or
whether they be evil. Now, behold, I have spoken unto you,
concerning the death of the mortal body, and also concerning
the resurrection of the mortal body. I say unto you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[403]</a></span>
that this mortal body is raised to an immortal body; that is
from death; even from the first death unto life."<a name="FNanchor_1187_1187" id="FNanchor_1187_1187"></a><a href="#Footnote_1187_1187" class="fnanchor">[1187]</a></p>

<p><b>38.</b> Consider also the following:&mdash;"The death of Christ
bringeth to pass the resurrection, which bringeth to pass a
redemption from an endless sleep, from which sleep all men
shall be awoke by the power of God when the trump shall
sound; and they shall come forth, both small and great, and
all shall stand before his bar, being redeemed and loosed
from this eternal band of death, which death is a temporal
death; And then cometh the judgment of the Holy One
upon them, and then cometh the time that he that is filthy
shall be filthy still; and he that is righteous shall be
righteous still; he that is happy shall be happy still; and
he that is unhappy shall be unhappy still."<a name="FNanchor_1188_1188" id="FNanchor_1188_1188"></a><a href="#Footnote_1188_1188" class="fnanchor">[1188]</a></p>

<p><b>39.</b> So far has the word of revealed truth extended our
knowledge regarding the destiny of the children of God.
Beyond the regeneration of the earth, and the final judgment
of the just and the wicked, we know little except that
a plan of eternal progression has been provided.</p>


<h3>NOTES.</h3>

<blockquote>

<p><b>1. Pagan Ignorance Concerning the Resurrection.</b>&mdash;In connection with
the statement that human knowledge of the resurrection is based on revelation, the
following is of interest:&mdash;"Whatever heathen philosophers may have <em>guessed</em> as to
the immortality of the soul, even admitting that this was really the result of their own
speculations, and not at all due to the relics of tradition, it is certain that they never
reached so far as the doctrine of a bodily resurrection. Pliny, when enumerating the
things which it was not even in the power of God to do, specified these two&mdash;the endowment
of mortals with an eternal existence, and the recalling of the departed from
the grave (ii, c, vii). A similar opinion is enunciated by Æschylus in the 'Eumenides'
(647, 648). The utmost to which they attained in their ethical speculations was a conception
of the possible continuance of life, in some new forms and conditions, beyond
the grave; but this was all. A resurrection in the scripture sense of the word they
never imagined."&mdash;Cassell's <cite>Bible Dictionary</cite>, p. 936.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span></p>

<p><b>2. General Belief in a Resurrection.</b>&mdash;"This great event of the future, like
the doctrine of the resurrection of Christ, is so entirely a cardinal truth, that there
never has been a time in which it has not been an article of the Christian creed, the
only difference between the ancient creeds and our own, being that the latter has the
phrase 'resurrection of the body' whereas the former invariably uses the form 'resurrection
of the flesh.' The reason for the ancient mode of expression is stated by Jerome
to be, that since there are spiritual bodies, some might readily accept a resurrection of
the body in that sense, who would deny the actual resurrection of the flesh."&mdash;Cassell's
<cite>Bible Dictionary</cite>, p. 935.</p>

<p><b>3. The Sadducees</b>, when mentioned in the New Testament, are usually represented
as being in opposition to the Pharisees, the two classes constituting the most
influential of the sects existing among the Jews at the time of Christ. The two differed
on many fundamental matters of belief and practice, including pre-existence of spirits;
the reality of spiritual punishment and future retribution for sin; the necessity of self-denial
in individual life; the immortality of the soul; and the resurrection from the
dead; in all of which the Pharisees stood for the affirmative, while the Sadducees denied.
Josephus says:&mdash;"The doctrine of the Sadducees is that the soul and body perish together;
the law is all that they are concerned to observe" (Ant. xviii, 1, 4). The sect
consisted mainly of members of the aristocracy. Special mention of the Sadducees here
is suggested by their determined opposition to the doctrine of the resurrection, which
they sought to assail by arrogant assumption or to belittle by ridicule. Cassell's <cite>Bible
Dictionary</cite> gives place to the following:&mdash;"The Sadducees are never mentioned in
John's Gospel. The only occasion on which they are spoken of in the Gospels of Mark
and Luke is that referred to also by St. Matthew, on which they attempted to ridicule
the doctrine of the resurrection, by asking our Lord's opinion as to whose wife a woman
would be in the future world, who had been married to several in this world (Matt.
xxii, 23-32; Mark xii, 18-27; Luke xx, 27-38). Their question proceeded on the assumption
that the levirate law, as promulgated by Moses (Deut. xxv, 5-6), implied that the
Jewish law-giver had no resurrection of the dead in view. Our Lord's answer explained
the difficulty, affirmed the resurrection of the dead, and asserted the existence of angels,
which the Sadducees also denied (Matt. xxii, 30; Mark xii, 25; Luke xx, 35, 36; compare
with Acts xxiii, 8). He also quoted the divine announcement,&mdash;'I am the God of
Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob' (Exod. iii, 6, 15, 16), and founded
thereon by inference an argument not only for immortality, but also for the resurrection.
The words quoted must have been regarded by our Lord as implying that the patriarchs,
as parties to the covenant, were still in a state of conscious relation to God."</p>

<p><b>4. Heathen in the First Resurrection.</b>&mdash;The statement that the heathen
dead will have place in the first resurrection is sustained by the word of scripture, and
by a consideration of the principles of true justice according to which humanity is to
be judged. Man will be accounted blameless or guilty, according to his deeds as interpreted
in the light of the law under which he is required to live. It is inconsistent with
our conception of a just God, to believe Him capable of inflicting condemnation upon
any one for noncompliance with a requirement of which the person had no knowledge.
Nevertheless, the laws of the Church will not be suspended even in the case of those who
have sinned in darkness and ignorance; but it is reasonable to believe that the plan of
redemption will afford such benighted ones an opportunity of learning the laws of God;
and surely, as fast as they so learn, will obedience be required on pain of the penalty.
Note the following passages in addition to the citations in the text:</p>

<p>"And if there was no law given if men sinned, what could justice do, or mercy either;
for they would have no claim upon the creature?"&mdash;Alma xlii, 21.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[405]</a></span></p>

<p>"Wherefore he has given a law; and where there is no law given, there is no punishment;
and where there is no punishment, there is no condemnation; and where there is
no condemnation, the mercies of the Holy One of Israel have claim upon them, because
of the atonement; for they are delivered by the power of him."&mdash;II Nephi ix, 25.</p>

<p>"And moreover, I say unto you, that the time shall come, when the knowledge of a
Savior shall spread throughout every nation, kindred, tongue, and people. And behold,
when that time cometh, none shall be found blameless before God, except it be little
children, only through repentance and faith on the name of the Lord God Omnipotent."&mdash;Mos.
iii, 20-21. See also Helaman xv, 14-15.</p>

<p><b>5. The Intermediate State of the Soul; Paradise.</b>&mdash;The condition of
the spirits of men between death and the resurrection is a subject of great interest, and
one concerning which much dispute has arisen. The scriptures prove, that at the time
of man's final judgment he will stand before the bar of God, clothed in his resurrected
body, and this, irrespective of his condition of purity or guilt. While awaiting the time
of their coming forth, disembodied spirits exist in an intermediate state, of happiness
and rest or of suffering and suspense, according to their works in mortality. The prophet
Alma said:&mdash;"Now concerning the state of the soul between death and the resurrection.
Behold, it has been made known unto me, by an angel, that the spirits of all men, as
soon as they are departed from this mortal body; yea, the spirits of all men, whether
they be good or evil, are taken home to that God who gave them life. And then shall it
come to pass that the spirits of those who are righteous are received into a state of
happiness, which is called paradise; a state of rest; a state of peace, where they shall
rest from all their troubles and from all care, and sorrow, etc. And then shall it come
to pass, that the spirits of the wicked, yea, who are evil; for behold, they have no part
nor portion of the Spirit of the Lord; for behold, they chose evil works rather than
good; therefore the spirit of the devil did enter into them, and take possession of their
house; and these shall be cast out into outer darkness; there shall be weeping, and
wailing, and gnashing of teeth; and this because of their own iniquity; being led captive
by the will of the devil. Now this is the state of the souls of the wicked; yea, in darkness,
and a state of awful, fearful looking, for the fiery indignation of the wrath of God
upon them; thus they remain in this state, as well as the righteous in paradise until the
time of their resurrection."&mdash;Alma xl, 11-14.</p>

<p>Reference to paradise, as a place prepared for righteous spirits while awaiting the
resurrection, is made also by the first Nephi (II Nephi ix, 13), by a later prophet of the
same name (IV Nephi 14), and by Moroni (Moroni x, 34). New Testament mention
supports the same (Luke xxiii, 43; II Cor. xii, 4; Rev. ii, 7). Paradise, then, is not
the place of final glory; for such the thief who died with Christ was assuredly not prepared,
yet we cannot doubt the fulfillment of our Lord's promise that the penitent malefactor
should be with Him in paradise that day; and, moreover, the declaration of the
risen Savior to Mary Magdalene, three days later, that He had not at that time ascended
to His Father, is proof of His having spent the intermediate time in paradise.</p>

<p>The word "paradise," by its derivation through the Greek from the Persian, signifies
a pleasure ground.</p></blockquote>

<p><b>1. Man's Right to Freedom in Worship.</b>&mdash;The Latter-day
Saints proclaim their unqualified allegiance to the principles
of religious liberty and religious toleration. Freedom to
worship Almighty God as the conscience may dictate, they
claim as one of the inherent and inalienable rights of humanity.
The inspired framers of our charter of national independence
proclaimed to the world, as a self-evident truth,
that the common birthright of humanity gives to every man
a claim to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Happiness
is foreign, liberty but a name, and life a disappointment
to him who is denied the freedom to worship as he
may desire. No person possessing a regard for Deity and a
sense of duty toward that power Divine, can be happy if he
be restricted in the performance of the highest duty of his
existence. Could one be happy, though he were housed in
a palace, surrounded with all material comforts and provided
with every facility for intellectual enjoyment, if he were cut
off from communion with the being whom he loved the
most? To the man who has learned to know his Divine
Father, freedom of worship is preferable even to life.</p>

<p><b>2. What is Worship?</b>&mdash;The derivation of the term suggests
an answer. It comes to us as the lineal descendant
of a pair of Anglo-Saxon words (<em>weorth</em>, meaning
worthy, and <em>scipe</em>, the old form of <em>ship</em>, signifying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[407]</a></span>
condition or state), and conveys the thought of <em>worthy-ship</em>.
The worship of which one is capable depends upon his
comprehension of the worthiness characterizing the object
of his reverence. Man's capacity for worship is a measure
of his comprehension of God. The fuller the acquaintance,
the closer the communion between the worshiper and his
Deity, the more thorough and sincere will be his homage.
When we say of one, in figurative speech, that he is a worshiper
of the good, the beautiful, the true, we affirm that
he possesses a deeper and a more complete conception of
worth in the object of his adoration, than has another
whose perception does not lead him to reverence those
ennobling qualities.</p>

<p><b>3.</b> Man, then, will worship God according to his conception
of the Divine attributes and powers; and this conception
approaches the correct one in proportion to the spiritual
light that has come to him. True worship cannot exist
where there is no reverence or love for the object. This
reverence may be ill-founded; the adoration may be a species
of idolatry; the object may be in fact unworthy; yet of the
devotee it must be said that he worships if his conscience
clothe the idol with the attribute of worthy-ship. We have
spoken of "true worship;" the expression is a pleonasm.
Worship, as has been affirmed, is the heart-felt adoration
that is rendered as a result of a sincere conception of worthiness
on the part of the object; any manifestation of reverence
prompted by a conviction inferior to this is but a
counterfeit of worship. Call such "false worship" if you
choose, but let it be remembered that worship is necessarily
true, the word requires no adjective to extend its meaning,
nor to attest its genuineness. Worship is not a matter of
form, any more than is prayer. It consists not in posture
nor in gesture, in ritual nor in creed. Worship most profound
may be rendered with none of the artificial accessories<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[408]</a></span>
of ritualistic service; for altar, the stone in the desert may
serve; the peaks of the everlasting hills are temple spires;
the vault of heaven is of all the grandest cathedral dome.</p>

<p><b>4.</b> Man is at heart an inferior pattern of that which he
worships. The savage, who knows no triumph greater than
that of bloody victory over his enemy, who regards prowess
and physical strength as the most desirable qualities of his
race, and who looks upon revenge and vindictiveness as the
sweetest gratifications of life, will assuredly ascribe such
attributes to his deity; and will offer his profoundest reverence
in sacrifices of blood. All the revolting practices of
idolatry are traceable to perverted and fiendish conceptions
of human excellence, and these are reflected in the hideous
creations of man-made, devil-inspired deities. On the
other hand, the man whose enlightened soul has received
the impress of love, pure and undefiled, will ascribe to his
God the attributes of gentleness and affection, and will say
in his heart, "God is love." He alone who has acquired a
proper understanding of the glory and responsibility of
parenthood, can intelligently use the Son's title of invocation,
"Our Father." Knowledge, therefore, is essential to
worship; man cannot adequately serve God in ignorance;
and the greater his knowledge of the Divine personality, the
fuller, truer, will be his adoration; he may learn to know
the Father, and the Son who was sent; and such knowledge
is man's guarantee to eternal life.</p>

<p><b>5.</b> Worship is the voluntary homage of the soul. Under
compulsion, or for the hypocritical purposes of effect,
one may insincerely perform all the outward ceremonies
of an established style of adoration; he may voice
words of prescribed prayers; his lips may profess a creed;
yet his effort is but a mockery of worship, and its indulgence
a sin. Our Father desires no reluctant homage nor
unwilling praise. Formalism in worship is acceptable only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[409]</a></span>
so far as it is accompanied by an intelligent devoutness; and
it is of use only as an aid to the spiritual devotion which
leads to communion with Deity. The spoken prayer is but
empty sound if it be anything less than an index to the
volume of the soul's righteous desire. Communications
addressed to the throne of Grace must bear the stamp of
sincerity if they are to reach their high destination. The
most acceptable form of worship is that which rests on an
unreserved compliance with the laws of God as the worshiper
has learned their purport.</p>

<p><b>6. Religious Intolerance.</b>&mdash;The Church holds, that the
right to worship according to the dictates of conscience has
been conferred upon man by an authority higher than any
of earth; and that, in consequence, no worldly power can
justly interfere with its exercise. The Latter-day Saints
accept as inspired the constitutional provision, by which
religious liberty within our own nation is professedly
guarded, that no law shall ever be made "respecting an
establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise
thereof;"<a name="FNanchor_1189_1189" id="FNanchor_1189_1189"></a><a href="#Footnote_1189_1189" class="fnanchor">[1189]</a> and they confidently believe that, with the spread
of enlightenment throughout the world, a similar guarantee
will be acquired by every nation. Intolerance has been the
greatest hindrance to true progress in every period of
time; yet under the sable cloak of perverted zeal for
religion, nations while boasting of their civilization, and
professed ministers of the gospel of Christ, have stained
the pages of the world's history with the record of such
unholy deeds of persecution as to make the heavens weep.
In this respect, so-called Christianity ought to bow its head
in shame before the record of even pagan toleration.
Rome, while arrogantly, though none the less effectively,
posing as the mistress of the world, granted to her vanquished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[410]</a></span>
subjects the rights of free worship, requiring of
them only that they refrain from molesting others or one
another in the exercise of such freedom.</p>

<p><b>7.</b> But as soon as the gospel of Christ was established
upon the earth, its devout adherents immediately, and its
more pretentious though less sincere devotees of a later day,
came to regard themselves as of such sanctity and excellence
that all who believed and professed not as did they, were
wholly unworthy of consideration. Nay, even long prior
to the advent of the Teacher of Love, Israel, knowing
the covenant of Divine favor under which they had flourished,
counted themselves sure of an exalted station, and
looked upon all who were not of the chosen seed as
unworthy. Christ, in His ministry among the Jews, saw
with compassionate sorrow the spiritual and intellectual
bondage of the times, and declared unto them the saving
word, saying, "The truth shall make you free." At this,
those self-righteous children of the covenant became angry,
and boastfully answered, "We be Abraham's seed, and were
never in bondage to any man; how sayest thou, Ye shall be
made free?" Then the Master reproved them for their
bigotry:&mdash;"I know that ye are Abraham's seed, but ye seek
to kill me, because my word has no place in you."<a name="FNanchor_1190_1190" id="FNanchor_1190_1190"></a><a href="#Footnote_1190_1190" class="fnanchor">[1190]</a></p>

<p><b>8.</b> There is little cause for wonder in the fact that the
early Christians, zealous for the new faith unto which they
had been baptized, and newly converted from idolatrous
practices and pagan superstitions, should consider themselves
superior to the rest of humanity still sitting in darkness
and ignorance. Even John, now known as the Apostle
of Love, but surnamed by the Christ, he and his brother
James, Boanerges, or Sons of Thunder,<a name="FNanchor_1191_1191" id="FNanchor_1191_1191"></a><a href="#Footnote_1191_1191" class="fnanchor">[1191]</a> was intolerant and
resentful toward those who followed not his path; and more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[411]</a></span>
than once he had to be rebuked by his Master. Note this
incident:&mdash;"And John answered him, saying, Master, we
saw one casting out devils in thy name, and he followeth
not us; and we forbade him because he followeth not us.
But Jesus said, Forbid him not: for there is no man which
shall do a miracle in my name, that can lightly speak evil
of me. For he that is not against us is on our part. For
whosoever shall give you a cup of water to drink in my
name, because ye belong to Christ, verily I say unto you, he
shall not lose his reward."<a name="FNanchor_1192_1192" id="FNanchor_1192_1192"></a><a href="#Footnote_1192_1192" class="fnanchor">[1192]</a> And again, while traveling with
their Lord through Samaria, the apostles James and John
were incensed at the Samaritans' neglect shown toward the
Master; and they craved permission to call fire from heaven
to consume the unbelievers, but their revengeful desire was
promptly rebuked by the Lord, who said, "Ye know not
what manner of spirit ye are of. For the Son of man is not
come to destroy men's lives, but to save them."<a name="FNanchor_1193_1193" id="FNanchor_1193_1193"></a><a href="#Footnote_1193_1193" class="fnanchor">[1193]</a></p>

<p><b>9. Intolerance is Unscriptural.</b>&mdash;The teachings of our
Lord breathe the spirit of forbearance and love even to
enemies. He tolerated, though he could not approve, the
practices of the heathen in their idolatry, the Samaritans
with their mongrel and unorthodox customs of worship,
the luxury-loving Sadducees, and the law-bound Pharisees.
Hatred was not countenanced even toward foes. His
instructions were:&mdash;"Love your enemies, bless them that
curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for
them which despitefully use you, and persecute you; that ye
may be the children of your Father which is in heaven:
for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good,
and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust."<a name="FNanchor_1194_1194" id="FNanchor_1194_1194"></a><a href="#Footnote_1194_1194" class="fnanchor">[1194]</a> The
Twelve were commanded to salute with their blessing every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[412]</a></span>
house at which they applied for hospitality. True, if the
people rejected them and their message, retribution was to
follow; but this visitation of cursing was to be reserved as
a Divine prerogative for the judgment day. In His Parable
of the Tares, Christ taught the same lesson of forbearance;
the hasty servants wanted to pluck out the weeds straightway,
but they were forbidden lest they root up the wheat
also; and were assured that a separation would be effected
in the time of harvest.<a name="FNanchor_1195_1195" id="FNanchor_1195_1195"></a><a href="#Footnote_1195_1195" class="fnanchor">[1195]</a></p>

<p><b>10.</b> In spite of the prevailing spirit of toleration and
love which pervades the teachings of the Savior and His
apostles, attempts have been made to draw from the scriptures
justification for intolerance and persecution.<a name="FNanchor_1196_1196" id="FNanchor_1196_1196"></a><a href="#Footnote_1196_1196" class="fnanchor">[1196]</a> Paul's
stinging words, addressed to the Galatians, have been given
a meaning wholly foreign to the spirit which prompted
them. Warning the Saints of false teachers, he said:&mdash;"As
we said before, so say I now again, If any man preach any
other gospel unto you than that ye have received, let him
be accursed."<a name="FNanchor_1197_1197" id="FNanchor_1197_1197"></a><a href="#Footnote_1197_1197" class="fnanchor">[1197]</a> With such an utterance, self-styled ministers
of Christ, who, if the whole truth were considered,
are perhaps preaching doctrines foreign to the apostolic
precepts, seek to justify their sectarian hatred and unchristian
cruelty; forgetting that vengeance and recompense
belong to the Lord.<a name="FNanchor_1198_1198" id="FNanchor_1198_1198"></a><a href="#Footnote_1198_1198" class="fnanchor">[1198]</a></p>

<p><b>11.</b> The intent of John's words of counsel to the Elect
Lady has been perverted, and his teachings have been made
a cover of refuge for persecutors and bigots. Warning
her of the ministers of Antichrist who were industriously
disseminating their heresies, the apostle wrote:&mdash;"If there
come any unto you, and bring not this doctrine, receive him
not into your house, neither bid him God-speed: for he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[413]</a></span>
that biddeth him God-speed is partaker of his evil deeds."<a name="FNanchor_1199_1199" id="FNanchor_1199_1199"></a><a href="#Footnote_1199_1199" class="fnanchor">[1199]</a>
By no rightful interpretation can these words be made to
sanction intolerance, persecution, and hatred.</p>

<p><b>12.</b> The apostle's true meaning has been set forth with
clearness and force by a renowned Christian writer of the
present day, who, after deploring the "narrow intolerance
of an ignorant dogmatism," says:&mdash;"The Apostle of Love
would have belied all that is best in his own teaching if he
had consciously given an absolution, nay, an incentive, to
furious intolerance.... Meanwhile, this incidental
expression of St. John's brief letter will not lend itself to
these gross perversions. What St. John really says and
really means, is something wholly different. False teachers
were rife, who, professing to be Christians, robbed the
nature of Christ of all which gave its efficacy to the atonement,
and its significance to the incarnation. These teachers,
like other Christian missionaries, traveled from city to
city; and, in the absence of public inns, were received into
the houses of Christian converts. The Christian lady to
whom St. John writes is warned, that if she offers her hospitality
to these dangerous emissaries, who were subverting
the central truth of Christianity, she is expressing a public
sanction of them; and by doing this, and offering them
her best wishes, she is taking a direct share in the harm they
do. This is common sense, nor is there anything uncharitable
in it. No one is bound to help forward the dissemination
of teaching what he regards as erroneous respecting
the most essential doctrines of his own faith. Still less
would it have been right to do this in the days when Christian
communities were so small and weak. But, to interpret
this as it has in all ages been practically interpreted&mdash;to
pervert it into a sort of command to exaggerate the minor
variations between religious opinions, and to persecute those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[414]</a></span>
whose views differ from our own&mdash;to make our own opinions
the conclusive test of heresy, and to say with Cornelius-a-Lapide,
that this verse reprobates 'all conversations, all
intercourse, all dealings with heretics'&mdash;is to interpret
scripture by the glare of partisanship and spiritual
self-satisfaction, not to read it under the light of holy love."<a name="FNanchor_1200_1200" id="FNanchor_1200_1200"></a><a href="#Footnote_1200_1200" class="fnanchor">[1200]</a></p>

<p><b>13. Toleration is not Acceptance.</b>&mdash;The human frailty of
running to extremes in thought and action finds few more
glaring examples than are presented in man's dealings with
his fellows on matters religious. On the one hand, he is
prone to regard the faith of others as not merely inferior to
his own, but as utterly unworthy of his respect; or, on the
other, he brings himself to believe that all sects are equally
justified in their professions and practices, and that therefore
there is no distinctively true order of religion. It is in
no wise inconsistent for Latter-day Saints to boldly proclaim
the conviction, that their own Church is the accepted one,
the only one entitled to the designation "Church of Jesus
Christ," and the sole earthly repository of the eternal priesthood
in the present age; and yet to willingly accord kind
treatment and a recognition of sincerity of purpose to every
soul or sect honestly professing Christ, or merely showing a
respect for truth, and manifesting a sincere desire to walk
according to the light received. My allegiance to the Church
of my choice is based on a conviction of the validity and
genuineness of its high claim to distinction, as the one and
only Church possessing a God-given charter of authority;
nevertheless, I count the sects as sincere until they demonstrate
that they are otherwise, and am prepared to defend
them in their rights.</p>

<p><b>14.</b> Joseph Smith, the first prophet of the last dispensation,
while reproving certain of his brethren for intolerance
toward the cherished beliefs of other men, taught that even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[415]</a></span>
idolaters ought to be protected in their worship; that, while
it would be the strict duty of any Christian to direct his
efforts toward enlightening such benighted minds, he would
not be justified in forcibly depriving even the heathen of their
rights of adoration. In the pure eyes of God, idolatry is
one of the most heinous of sins; yet He is tolerant of those
who, knowing Him not, yield to their inherited instinct for
worship by rendering homage even to stocks and stones.
Deadly as is the sin of idolatrous worship on the part of him
to whom light has come, it may represent in the savage the
sincerest reverence of which he is capable. And, as set
forth in a preceding lecture,<a name="FNanchor_1201_1201" id="FNanchor_1201_1201"></a><a href="#Footnote_1201_1201" class="fnanchor">[1201]</a> the voice of the Eternal One
has declared that the heathen who have known no law shall
have part in the first resurrection.</p>

<p><b>15.</b> What justification can man find for intolerance
toward his fellow, when God, who is grieved over every sin,
manifests so marked a forbearance? The free agency of the
human soul is sacred to Deity.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="line">"Know this, that every soul is free,</div>
<div class="line">To choose his life, and what he'll be;</div>

</div></div>

<p><b>16. Man is strictly Answerable for his Acts.</b>&mdash;The unbounded
liberality and true tolerance with which the
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints regards other
religious denominations, and the teachings of the Church
respecting the assurance of final redemption for all men except
the few who have fallen so far as to have committed
the unpardonable sin, thereby becoming Sons of Perdition,
may suggest the erroneous conclusion, that we believe that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[416]</a></span>
all so redeemed shall be admitted to equal powers, privileges,
and glories in the Heaven of our God. Far from this, the
Church proclaims the doctrine of many and varied degrees
of glory, which the redeemed will inherit in strict accordance
with their merits.<a name="FNanchor_1202_1202" id="FNanchor_1202_1202"></a><a href="#Footnote_1202_1202" class="fnanchor">[1202]</a> We believe in no general plan of
universal forgiveness or reward, by which sinners of high
and low degree shall be exempted from the effects of their
deeds, while the righteous are ushered into heaven as a
dwelling place in common, all glorified in the same measure.
As stated, the heathen whose sins are those of ignorance,
are to come forth with the just in the first resurrection;
but this does not imply that those children of the lower
races are to inherit the glory provided for the able, the
valiant, and the true, in the cause of God on earth.</p>

<p><b>17.</b> Our condition in the world to come will be strictly
a result of the life we lead in this probation, as, by the light
of revealed truth regarding the pre-existent state,<a name="FNanchor_1203_1203" id="FNanchor_1203_1203"></a><a href="#Footnote_1203_1203" class="fnanchor">[1203]</a> we perceive
our present condition to be determined by the
fidelity with which we kept our first estate. The scriptures
repeatedly declare that man will reap the natural
harvest of his works in life, be such good or evil; in the
effective language with which the Father encourages and
warns his frail children, every one will be rewarded or
punished according to his works.<a name="FNanchor_1204_1204" id="FNanchor_1204_1204"></a><a href="#Footnote_1204_1204" class="fnanchor">[1204]</a> In eternity, man will
enjoy or loath the "fruit of his doing."</p>

<p><b>18. Degrees of Glory.</b>&mdash;That the privileges and glories of
heaven are graded to suit the various capacities of the
blessed, is indicated in Christ's teachings. To His apostles
He said:&mdash;"In my Father's house are many mansions: if it
were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place
for you. And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[417]</a></span>
come again, and receive you unto myself; that where I am,
there ye may be also."<a name="FNanchor_1205_1205" id="FNanchor_1205_1205"></a><a href="#Footnote_1205_1205" class="fnanchor">[1205]</a></p>

<p><b>19.</b> This utterance is supplemented by that of Paul, who
speaks of the graded glories of the resurrection as follows:&mdash;"There
are also celestial bodies, and bodies terrestrial:
but the glory of the celestial is one, and the glory of the
terrestrial is another. There is one glory of the sun, and
another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars;
for one star differeth from another star in glory. So also is
the resurrection of the dead."<a name="FNanchor_1206_1206" id="FNanchor_1206_1206"></a><a href="#Footnote_1206_1206" class="fnanchor">[1206]</a></p>

<p><b>20.</b> A fuller knowledge of this subject has been imparted
in the present dispensation. From a revelation given
in 1832<a name="FNanchor_1207_1207" id="FNanchor_1207_1207"></a><a href="#Footnote_1207_1207" class="fnanchor">[1207]</a> we learn the following:&mdash;Three great kingdoms or
degrees of glory are established for the future habitation of
the human race; these are known as the Celestial, the
Terrestrial, and the Telestial. Far below the last and least
of these, is the state of eternal punishment prepared for the
Sons of Perdition.</p>

<p><b>21. The Celestial Glory</b> is provided for those who merit
the highest honors of heaven. In the revelation referred to,
we read of them:&mdash;"They are they who received the testimony
of Jesus, and believed on his name and were baptized
after the manner of his burial, being buried in the water in
his name, and this according to the commandment which
he has given, that by keeping the commandments they
might be washed and cleansed from all their sins, and receive
the Holy Spirit by the laying on of the hands of him who is
ordained and sealed unto this power, and who overcome by
faith, and are sealed by the Holy Spirit of promise, which
the Father sheds forth upon all those who are just and true.
They are they who are the Church of the First-born. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[418]</a></span>
are they into whose hands the Father has given all things,&mdash;they
are they who are Priests and Kings, who have
received of his fulness, and of his glory, and are Priests of
the Most High, after the order of Melchisedek, which was
after the order of Enoch, which was after the order of the
Only Begotten Son; wherefore, as it is written, they are
Gods, even the sons of God;&mdash;wherefore all things are theirs,
whether life or death, or things present, or things to come,
all are theirs, and they are Christ's, and Christ is God's....
These shall dwell in the presence of God and his
Christ for ever and ever. These are they whom he shall
bring with him, when he shall come in the clouds of heaven,
to reign on the earth over his people. These are they who
shall have part in the first resurrection. These are they
who shall come forth in the resurrection of the just....
These are they who are just men made perfect through
Jesus, the mediator of the new covenant, who wrought out
this perfect atonement through the shedding of his own
blood. These are they whose bodies are celestial, whose
glory is that of the sun, even the glory of God, the highest
of all, whose glory the sun of the firmament is written of as
being typical."<a name="FNanchor_1208_1208" id="FNanchor_1208_1208"></a><a href="#Footnote_1208_1208" class="fnanchor">[1208]</a></p>

<p><b>22. The Terrestrial Glory.</b>&mdash;This, the next lower degree,
will be attained by many whose works do not merit the highest
reward. We read of them:&mdash;"These are they who are
of the terrestrial, whose glory differs from that of the Church
of the First-born who have received the fulness of the
Father, even as that of the moon differs from the sun in the
firmament. Behold, these are they who died without law,
and also they who are the spirits of men kept in prison, whom
the Son visited, and preached the Gospel unto them, that
they might be judged according to men in the flesh, who
received not the testimony of Jesus in the flesh, but afterwards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[419]</a></span>
received it. These are they who are honorable men
of the earth, who were blinded by the craftiness of men.
These are they who receive of his glory, but not of his
fulness. These are they who receive of the presence of the
Son, but not of the fulness of the Father; wherefore they
are bodies terrestrial, and not bodies celestial, and differ in
glory as the moon differs from the sun. These are they
who are not valiant in the testimony of Jesus; wherefore
they obtain not the crown over the kingdom of our God."<a name="FNanchor_1209_1209" id="FNanchor_1209_1209"></a><a href="#Footnote_1209_1209" class="fnanchor">[1209]</a></p>

<p><b>23. The Telestial Glory.</b>&mdash;The revelation continues:&mdash;"And
again, we saw the glory of the telestial,<a name="FNanchor_1210_1210" id="FNanchor_1210_1210"></a><a href="#Footnote_1210_1210" class="fnanchor">[1210]</a> which glory
is that of the lesser, even as the glory of the stars differs
from that of the glory of the moon in the firmament.
These are they who received not the gospel of Christ, neither
the testimony of Jesus. These are they who deny not the
Holy Spirit. These are they who are thrust down to hell.
These are they who shall not be redeemed from the devil,
until the last resurrection, until the Lord, even Christ the
Lamb shall have finished his work."<a name="FNanchor_1211_1211" id="FNanchor_1211_1211"></a><a href="#Footnote_1211_1211" class="fnanchor">[1211]</a> We learn further
that the inhabitants of this kingdom are to be graded
among themselves, comprising as they do the unenlightened
among the varied opposing sects and divisions of
men, and sinners of many types, whose offences are not
those of utter perdition;&mdash;"For as one star differs from
another star in glory, even so differs one from another in
glory in the telestial world; for these are they who are of
Paul, and of Apollos, and of Cephas. These are they who
say they are some of one and some of another&mdash;some of
Christ, and some of John, and some of Moses, and some of
Elias, and some of Esaias, and some of Isaiah, and some of
Enoch; but received not the gospel, neither the testimony<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[420]</a></span>
of Jesus, neither the prophets, neither the everlasting covenant."<a name="FNanchor_1212_1212" id="FNanchor_1212_1212"></a><a href="#Footnote_1212_1212" class="fnanchor">[1212]</a>
Evidently a considerable part of the human family
will fail of all glory beyond that of the telestial kingdom,
for we are told,&mdash;"But behold, and lo, we saw the glory and
the inhabitants of the telestial world, that they were as
innumerable as the stars in the firmament of heaven, or as
the sand upon the seashore."<a name="FNanchor_1213_1213" id="FNanchor_1213_1213"></a><a href="#Footnote_1213_1213" class="fnanchor">[1213]</a> They are thus not wholly
rejected; their every merit will be respected. "For they
shall be judged according to their works, and every man
shall receive according to his own works, his own dominion
in the mansions which are prepared; and they shall be
servants of the Most High, but where God and Christ dwell,
they cannot come, worlds without end."<a name="FNanchor_1214_1214" id="FNanchor_1214_1214"></a><a href="#Footnote_1214_1214" class="fnanchor">[1214]</a></p>

<p><b>24. The Kingdoms with Respect to One Another.</b>&mdash;The
three kingdoms of widely differing glories are themselves
organized on an orderly plan of gradation. We have seen
that the telestial kingdom comprises a multitude of subdivisions;
this also is the case, we are told, with the
celestial;<a name="FNanchor_1215_1215" id="FNanchor_1215_1215"></a><a href="#Footnote_1215_1215" class="fnanchor">[1215]</a> and, by analogy, we conclude that a similar condition
prevails in the terrestrial. Thus the innumerable
degrees of merit amongst mankind are provided for in an
infinity of graded glories. The Celestial kingdom is
supremely honored by the personal ministrations of the
Father and the Son.<a name="FNanchor_1216_1216" id="FNanchor_1216_1216"></a><a href="#Footnote_1216_1216" class="fnanchor">[1216]</a> The Terrestrial kingdom will be
administered through the higher, without a fullness of
glory. The Telestial is governed through the ministrations
of the Terrestrial, by "angels who are appointed to minister
for them."<a name="FNanchor_1217_1217" id="FNanchor_1217_1217"></a><a href="#Footnote_1217_1217" class="fnanchor">[1217]</a></p>

<p><b>25.</b> It is reasonable to believe, in the absence of direct<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[421]</a></span>
revelation by which alone absolute knowledge of the matter
could be acquired, that, in accordance with God's plan of
eternal progression, advancement from grade to grade
within each of the three specified kingdoms will be
provided for. But if the recipients of a lower glory be
enabled to advance, surely the intelligences of higher rank
shall not be stopped in their progress; and thus we may
conclude that degrees and grades will ever characterize the
kingdoms of our God. Eternity is progressive; perfection
is relative; the essential feature of God's living purpose is
its associated power of eternal increase.</p>

<p><b>26. The Sons of Perdition.</b>&mdash;We learn of another class of
souls whose sins are such as to place them beyond the present
possibility of redemption. These are called Sons of Perdition;
children of the fallen angel, once a Son of the Morning,
now Lucifer, or Perdition.<a name="FNanchor_1218_1218" id="FNanchor_1218_1218"></a><a href="#Footnote_1218_1218" class="fnanchor">[1218]</a> These are they who have
violated truth in the full blaze of the light of knowledge;
who, having received the testimony of Christ, and having
been endowed by the Holy Spirit, then deny the same and
defy the power of God, crucifying the Lord afresh, and putting
Him to an open shame. This, the unpardonable sin,
can be committed by those only who have received the
knowledge and the sacred conviction of the truth, against
which they then rebel. Their sin is comparable to the
treason of Lucifer, by which he sought to usurp the power
and glory of his God. Concerning them and their dreadful
fate, the Almighty has said:&mdash;"I say that it had been better
for them never to have been born; for they are vessels of
wrath, doomed to suffer the wrath of God, with the devil
and his angels in eternity; concerning whom I have
said, there is no forgiveness in this world nor in the world
to come.... They shall go away into everlasting
punishment, which is endless punishment, which is eternal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[422]</a></span>
punishment, to reign with the devil and his angels in eternity,
where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched,
which is their torment; And the end thereof, neither the
place thereof, nor their torment, no man knows; neither was
it revealed, neither is, neither will be revealed unto man,
except to them who are made partakers thereof: Nevertheless
I, the Lord, show it by vision unto many, but straightway
shut it up again; wherefore the end, the width, the
height, the depth, and the misery thereof, they understand
not, neither any man except them who are ordained unto
this condemnation."<a name="FNanchor_1219_1219" id="FNanchor_1219_1219"></a><a href="#Footnote_1219_1219" class="fnanchor">[1219]</a></p>

<p><b>27.</b> Surely the doctrines of the Church are explicit in
defining the relationship between the mortal probation and
the future state, and in teaching the individual accountability
and the free agency of man. The Church affirms that in
view of the terrible responsibility under which every man
rests, as the unrestrained director of his own course, he must
be and is free to choose in all things, from the life that
leads to the celestial home, to the career that is but the
introduction to the miseries of perdition. Freedom to
worship, or to refuse to worship, is a God-given right.</p>


<h3>NOTES.</h3>

<blockquote>

<p><b>1. Intolerance among Christians To-day.</b>&mdash;"It must be said&mdash;though I
say it with the deepest sorrow&mdash;that the cold exclusiveness of the Pharisee, the bitter
ignorance of the self-styled theologian, the usurped infallibility of the half-educated religionist,
have been ever the curse of Christianity. They have imposed 'the senses of
men upon the words of God, the special senses of men on the general words of God;'
and have tried to enforce them on all men's consciences with all kinds of burnings and
anathemas under equal threats of death and damnation. And thus they incurred the
terrible responsibility of presenting religion to mankind in a false and repellent guise.
Is theological hatred still to be a proverb for the world's just contempt? Is such hatred&mdash;hatred
in its bitterest and most ruthless form&mdash;to be regarded as the legitimate and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[423]</a></span>
normal outcome of the religion of love? Is the spirit of peace never to be
brought to bear on religious opinions? Are such questions always to excite the
most intense animosities, and the most terrible divisions?... Is the world
to be forever confirmed in its opinion that theological partisans are less truthful,
less candid, less high-minded, less honorable even than the partisans of political
and social causes, who make no profession as to the duty of love? Are the
so-called 'religious' champions to be forever as they now are, the most unscrupulously
bitter, the most conspicuously unfair? Alas! they might be so with far
less danger to the cause of religion if they would forego the luxury of 'quoting
scripture for their purpose.'"&mdash;Canon Farrar, <cite>The Early Days of Christianity</cite>,
pp. 584-585.</p>

<p><b>2. "Telestial."</b>&mdash;The adjective "telestial" has not become current in the language;
its use is at present confined to the theology of the Church of Jesus Christ of
Latter-day Saints. It is applied as a distinguishing term to the lowest of the three kingdoms
of glory provided for the redeemed. The only English word approaching it in
form is the adjective "telestic," which is defined thus:&mdash;"tending toward the end or
final accomplishment; tending to accomplish a purpose."</p>

<p><b>3. Toleration.</b>&mdash;"'Mormonism' offers no modified or conditional claims as to the
necessity of compliance with the laws and ordinances of the gospel by every independent
inhabitant of earth unto whom salvation shall come. It distinguishes not between enlightened
and heathen nations, nor between men of high or low intelligence; nor even
between the living and the dead. No human being who has attained years of accountability
in the flesh, may hope for salvation in the kingdom of God until he has rendered
obedience to the requirements of Christ, the Redeemer of the world. But while thus decisive,
'Mormonism' is not exclusive. It does not claim that all who have failed to accept
and obey the gospel of eternal life shall be eternally and forever damned. While boldly asserting
that the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is the sole repository of the
Holy Priesthood as now restored to earth, it teaches and demands the fullest toleration
for all individuals, and organizations of individuals, professing righteousness; and holds
that each shall be rewarded for the measure of good he has wrought, to be adjudged in
accordance with the spiritual knowledge he has gained. And for such high claims combined
with such professions of tolerance, the Church has been accused of inconsistency.
Let it not be forgotten, however, that toleration is not acceptance. I may believe with
the utmost fulness of my soul's powers that I am right and my neighbor is wrong concerning
any proposition or principle; but such conviction gives me no semblance of
right for interfering with his exercise of freedom. The only bounds to the liberty of an
individual are such as mark the liberty of another, or the rights of the community. God
himself treats as sacred, and therefore as inviolable, the freedom of the human soul.
'Mormonism' contends that no man or nation possesses the right to forcibly deprive even
the heathen of his right to worship his deity. Though idolatry has been marked from
the earliest ages with the seal of divine disfavor, it may represent in the benighted mind
the sincerest reverence of which the person is capable. He should be taught better, but
never compelled. There is no claim of universal forgiveness; no unwarranted glorification
of Mercy to the degrading or neglect of Justice; no thought that a single sin of
omission or of commission shall fail to leave its wound or scar. In the great future there
shall be found a place for every soul, whatever his grade of spiritual intelligence may
be."&mdash;<cite>The Philosophy of Mormonism</cite>: The Author, in <cite>Improvement Era</cite>, vol. iv, pp.
502-504.</p></blockquote>

<h3>SUBMISSION TO SECULAR AUTHORITY.</h3>

<blockquote>

<p><b>Article 12.</b>&mdash;We believe in being subject to kings, presidents, rulers, and magistrates,
in obeying, honoring, and sustaining the law.</p></blockquote>


<p><b>1. Introductory.</b>&mdash;It is but reasonable to expect of a
people professing the Gospel of Christ, and claiming membership
in the one accepted and divinely invested Church,
that they manifest in practice the virtues which their
precepts inculcate. True, we may look in vain for perfection
among those even who make the fullest and most
justifiable claims to orthodoxy; but we have a right to
expect in their creed ample requirements concerning the
most approved course of action, and in their lives, sincere
and earnest effort toward the practical realization of their
professions. Religion, to be of service and at all worthy of
acceptance, must be of wholesome influence in the individual
lives and the temporal affairs of its adherents.
Among other virtues, the Church in its teachings should impress
the duty of a law-abiding course; and the people
should show forth the effect of such precepts in their excellence
as citizens of the nation, and as individuals in the
community of which they are part.</p>

<p><b>2.</b> The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints
makes emphatic declaration of its belief and precepts regarding
the duty of its members toward the laws of the
land; and sustains its position by the authority of specific
revelation in ancient as in present times. Moreover, the
people are confident, that when the true story of their rise
and progress as an established body of religious worshipers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[425]</a></span>
is written, the loyalty of the Church and the patriotic
devotion of its members will be vindicated and extolled
by the world in general, as now are these virtues recognized
by the few unprejudiced investigators who have
studied with honest purpose the history of this remarkable
organization.</p>

<p><b>3. Obedience to Authority Enjoined by Scripture.&mdash;</b>During
the patriarchal period, when the head of the family
possessed virtually the power of judge and king over his
household, the authority of the ruler and the rights of the
family were respected. Consider the instance of Hagar,
the "plural" wife of Abram, and the handmaid of Sarai.
Jealousy and ill-feeling had arisen between Hagar and
her mistress, the senior wife of the patriarch. Abram
listened to the complaint of Sarai, and, recognizing her
authority over Hagar, who, though his wife, was still
the servant of Sarai, said:&mdash;"Behold thy maid is in thy
hand; do to her as it pleaseth thee." Then, as the mistress
dealt harshly with her servant, Hagar fled into the wilderness;
there she was visited by an angel of the Lord, who addressed
her thus:&mdash;"Hagar, Sarai's maid, whence camest
thou, and whither wilt thou go? And she said, I flee from
the face of my mistress Sarai. And the angel of the Lord
said unto her, Return to thy mistress, and submit thyself
under her hands."<a name="FNanchor_1220_1220" id="FNanchor_1220_1220"></a><a href="#Footnote_1220_1220" class="fnanchor">[1220]</a> Observe that the heavenly messenger
recognized the authority of the mistress over the bond-woman,
even though the latter had been given the rank of
wifehood in the family.</p>

<p><b>4.</b> The ready submission of Isaac to the will of his
father, even to the extent of offering his life<a name="FNanchor_1221_1221" id="FNanchor_1221_1221"></a><a href="#Footnote_1221_1221" class="fnanchor">[1221]</a> on the altar of
bloody sacrifice, is evidence of the sanctity with which
the authority of the family ruler was regarded. It may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[426]</a></span>
appear, as indeed it has been claimed, that the requirement
which the Lord made of Abraham as a test of faith, in the
matter of giving his son's life as a sacrifice, was a violation
of existing laws, and therefore opposed to stable government.
The claim is poorly placed in view of the fact, that
the patriarchal head was possessed of absolute authority
over the members of his household, the power extending
even to judgment of life or death.<a name="FNanchor_1222_1222" id="FNanchor_1222_1222"></a><a href="#Footnote_1222_1222" class="fnanchor">[1222]</a></p>

<p><b>5.</b> In the days of the exodus, when Israel were ruled by
a theocracy, the Lord gave divers laws and commandments
for the government of His chosen people; among them we
read:&mdash;"Thou shalt not revile the gods, nor curse the ruler
of thy people."<a name="FNanchor_1223_1223" id="FNanchor_1223_1223"></a><a href="#Footnote_1223_1223" class="fnanchor">[1223]</a> Judges were appointed by Divine direction
to exercise authority amongst Israel. Moses, in reiterating
the Lord's commands, charged the people to this effect:&mdash;"Judges
and officers shalt thou make thee in all thy gates,
which the Lord thy God giveth thee, throughout thy tribes;
and they shall judge the people with just judgment."<a name="FNanchor_1224_1224" id="FNanchor_1224_1224"></a><a href="#Footnote_1224_1224" class="fnanchor">[1224]</a></p>

<p><b>6.</b> When the people wearied of God's direct control,
and clamored for a king, the Lord yielded to their desire,
and gave the new ruler authority by a holy anointing.<a name="FNanchor_1225_1225" id="FNanchor_1225_1225"></a><a href="#Footnote_1225_1225" class="fnanchor">[1225]</a>
David, even though he had been anointed to succeed Saul
on the throne, recognized the sanctity of the king's person,
and bitterly reproached himself because on one occasion he
had mutilated the robe of the monarch. True, Saul was at
that time seeking David's life, and the latter sought only a
means of showing that he had no intent to kill his royal
enemy; yet we are told:&mdash;"That David's heart smote him,
because he had cut off Saul's skirt. And he said unto his
men, The Lord forbid that I should do this thing unto my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[427]</a></span>
master, the Lord's anointed, to stretch forth mine hand
against him, seeing he is the anointed of the Lord."<a name="FNanchor_1226_1226" id="FNanchor_1226_1226"></a><a href="#Footnote_1226_1226" class="fnanchor">[1226]</a></p>

<p><b>7.</b> Note, further, the following scriptural adjurations as
recorded in the Old Testament:&mdash;"My son, fear thou the
Lord, and the king."<a name="FNanchor_1227_1227" id="FNanchor_1227_1227"></a><a href="#Footnote_1227_1227" class="fnanchor">[1227]</a> "I counsel thee to keep the king's
commandment, and that in regard of the oath of God."<a name="FNanchor_1228_1228" id="FNanchor_1228_1228"></a><a href="#Footnote_1228_1228" class="fnanchor">[1228]</a>
"Curse not the king, no not in thy thought."<a name="FNanchor_1229_1229" id="FNanchor_1229_1229"></a><a href="#Footnote_1229_1229" class="fnanchor">[1229]</a></p>

<p><b>8. Examples Set by Christ and His Apostles.</b>&mdash;Our
Savior's work on earth was marked throughout by His
acknowledgment of the existing powers of the land, even
though the authority had been won by cruel conquest, and
was exercised unjustly. When the tax-collector called for the
tribute money demanded by the hierarchy, Christ, though
not admitting the justice of the claim, directed that the
tax be paid, and even invoked a miraculous circumstance
whereby the money could be provided. Of Peter he asked:&mdash;"What
thinkest thou, Simon? of whom do the kings of the
earth take custom or tribute? of their own children, or of
strangers? Peter saith unto him, Of strangers. Jesus
saith unto him, Then are the children free. Notwithstanding,
lest we should offend them, go thou to the sea, and
cast an hook, and take up the fish that first cometh up;
and when thou hast opened his mouth, thou shall find a
piece of money: that take, and give unto them for me and
thee."<a name="FNanchor_1230_1230" id="FNanchor_1230_1230"></a><a href="#Footnote_1230_1230" class="fnanchor">[1230]</a></p>

<p><b>9.</b> At the instigation of certain wicked Pharisees, a
treacherous plot was laid to make Christ appear as an
offender against the ruling powers. They sought to catch
Him by the hypocritical question,&mdash;"What thinkest thou?
Is it lawful to give tribute unto Cæsar or not?" His answer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[428]</a></span>
was an unequivocal endorsement of submission to the laws.
To His questioners He replied:&mdash;"Shew me the tribute
money. And they brought unto him a penny. And he
saith unto them, Whose is this image and superscription?
They say unto him, Cæsar's. Then saith he unto them,
Render therefore unto Cæsar the things which are Cæsar's;
and unto God the things that are God's."<a name="FNanchor_1231_1231" id="FNanchor_1231_1231"></a><a href="#Footnote_1231_1231" class="fnanchor">[1231]</a></p>

<p><b>10.</b> Throughout the solemnly tragic circumstances of His
trial and condemnation, Christ maintained a submissive
demeanor even toward the chief priests and elders who
were plotting His death. These officers, however unworthy
of their priestly power, were nevertheless in authority, and
had a certain measure of jurisdiction in secular as in ecclesiastical
affairs. When He stood before Caiaphas, laden
with insult and accused by false witnesses, He maintained a
dignified silence. To the high priest's question,&mdash;"Answereth
thou nothing? What is it these witness against
thee?" He deigned no reply. Then the high priest added:&mdash;"I
adjure thee by the living God, that thou tell us whether
thou be the Christ, the Son of God."<a name="FNanchor_1232_1232" id="FNanchor_1232_1232"></a><a href="#Footnote_1232_1232" class="fnanchor">[1232]</a> To this solemn
adjuration, spoken with official authority, the Savior gave
an immediate answer; thus recognizing the office of the
high priest, however unworthy the man.</p>

<p><b>11.</b> A similar respect for the high priest's office was
shown by Paul while a prisoner before the tribunal. His
remarks displeased the high priest, who gave immediate
command to those who stood near Paul to smite him on the
mouth.<a name="FNanchor_1233_1233" id="FNanchor_1233_1233"></a><a href="#Footnote_1233_1233" class="fnanchor">[1233]</a> This angered the apostle, and he cried out:&mdash;"God
shall smite thee, thou whited wall: for sittest thou to judge
me after the law, and commandest me to be smitten contrary
to the law? And they that stood by said, Revilest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[429]</a></span>
thou God's high priest? Then said Paul, I wist not, brethren,
that he was the high priest: for it is written, Thou
shalt not speak evil of the ruler of thy people."<a name="FNanchor_1234_1234" id="FNanchor_1234_1234"></a><a href="#Footnote_1234_1234" class="fnanchor">[1234]</a></p>

<p><b>12. Teachings of the Apostles.</b>&mdash;Paul, writing to Titus,
who had been left in charge of the Church among the
Cretans, warns him of the weaknesses of his flock, and
urges him to teach them to be orderly and law-abiding:&mdash;"Put
them in mind to be subject to principalities and
powers, to obey magistrates, to be ready to every good
work."<a name="FNanchor_1235_1235" id="FNanchor_1235_1235"></a><a href="#Footnote_1235_1235" class="fnanchor">[1235]</a> In another place, Paul is emphatic in declaring the
duty of the Saints toward the civil power, such authority
being ordained of God. He points out the necessity of
secular government, and the need of officers in authority,
whose power will be feared by evil-doers only. He designates
the civil authorities as ministers of God; and justifies taxation
by the state, with an admonition that the Saints fail
not in their dues.</p>

<p><b>13.</b> These are his words addressed to the Church at
Rome:&mdash;"Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers.
For there is no power but of God: the powers that be are
ordained of God. Whosoever therefore resisteth the power,
resisteth the ordinance of God: and they that resist shall
receive to themselves damnation. For rulers are not a terror
to good works, but to the evil. Wilt thou then not be afraid
of the power? do that which is good, and thou shalt have
praise of the same: For he is the minister of God to thee
for good. But if thou do that which is evil, be afraid; for
he beareth not the sword in vain: for he is the minister of
God, a revenger to execute wrath upon him that doeth evil.
Wherefore ye must needs be subject, not only for wrath,
but also for conscience sake. For, for this cause pay ye
tribute also: for they are God's ministers, attending continually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[430]</a></span>
upon this very thing. Render therefore to all their
dues: tribute to whom tribute is due; custom to whom
custom; fear to whom fear; honor to whom honor."<a name="FNanchor_1236_1236" id="FNanchor_1236_1236"></a><a href="#Footnote_1236_1236" class="fnanchor">[1236]</a></p>

<p><b>14.</b> In a letter to Timothy, Paul teaches that in the
prayers of the Saints, kings and all in authority should be
remembered, adding that such remembrance is pleasing in
the sight of God:&mdash;"I exhort therefore, that, first of all, supplications,
prayers, intercessions, and giving of thanks, be
made for all men; For kings, and for all that are in authority;
that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all
godliness and honesty. For this is good and acceptable in
the sight of God our Savior."<a name="FNanchor_1237_1237" id="FNanchor_1237_1237"></a><a href="#Footnote_1237_1237" class="fnanchor">[1237]</a></p>

<p><b>15.</b> The duty of willing submission to authority is
elaborated in the epistles to the Ephesians and the Colossians;
and illustrations are applied to the relations of social
and domestic life. Wives are taught to be submissive to
their husbands,&mdash;"For the husband is the head of the wife,
even as Christ is the head of the church;" but this duty
within the family is reciprocal, and therefore husbands are
instructed as to the manner in which authority ought to be
exercised. Children are to obey their parents; yet the
parents are cautioned against provoking or otherwise offending
their little ones. Servants are told to render willing
and earnest service to their masters, recognizing in all

their duty toward their servants, being counseled to abandon
threatening and other harsh treatment, remembering that
they also will have to answer to a Master greater than themselves.<a name="FNanchor_1238_1238" id="FNanchor_1238_1238"></a><a href="#Footnote_1238_1238" class="fnanchor">[1238]</a></p>

<p><b>16.</b> Peter is not less emphatic in teaching the sanctity
with which the civil power should be regarded;<a name="FNanchor_1239_1239" id="FNanchor_1239_1239"></a><a href="#Footnote_1239_1239" class="fnanchor">[1239]</a> he admonishes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[431]</a></span>
the Saints in this wise:&mdash;"Submit yourselves to every
ordinance of man for the Lord's sake: whether it be to the
king, as supreme; or unto governors, as unto them that are
sent by him for the punishment of evil doers, and for the
praise of them that do well. For so is the will of God, that
with well doing ye may put to silence the ignorance of foolish
men: as free, and not using your liberty for a cloak of
maliciousness, but as the servants of God. Honor all men.
Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honor the king."<a name="FNanchor_1240_1240" id="FNanchor_1240_1240"></a><a href="#Footnote_1240_1240" class="fnanchor">[1240]</a></p>

<p><b>17.</b> These general rules, relating to submission to authority,
he applies, as did Paul similarly, to the conditions of
domestic life. Servants are to be obedient, even though
their masters be harsh and severe:&mdash;"For this is thankworthy,
if a man for conscience toward God endure grief,
suffering wrongfully. For what glory is it, if, when ye be
buffeted for your faults, ye take it patiently? but if,
when you do well, and suffer for it, ye take it patiently, this
is acceptable with God."<a name="FNanchor_1241_1241" id="FNanchor_1241_1241"></a><a href="#Footnote_1241_1241" class="fnanchor">[1241]</a> Wives also, even though their
husbands be not of their faith, are not to vaunt themselves
and defy authority, but to be submissive, and to rely upon
gentler and more effective means of influencing those whose
name they bear.<a name="FNanchor_1242_1242" id="FNanchor_1242_1242"></a><a href="#Footnote_1242_1242" class="fnanchor">[1242]</a> He gives assurance of the judgment which
shall overtake evil doers, and specifies as fit subjects for condemnation,
"chiefly them that walk after the flesh in the
lust of uncleanness, and despise government. Presumptuous
are they, self-willed, they are not afraid to speak evil of
dignities."<a name="FNanchor_1243_1243" id="FNanchor_1243_1243"></a><a href="#Footnote_1243_1243" class="fnanchor">[1243]</a></p>

<p><b>18.</b> Doubtless there existed excellent reason for these
explicit and repeated counsels against the spirit of revolt,
with which the apostles of old sought to lead and strengthen
the Church. The Saints rejoiced in their testimony of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[432]</a></span>
truth, that had found place in their hearts,&mdash;the truth that
was to make them free,&mdash;and it would have been but natural
for them to regard all others as inferior to themselves, and
to rebel against all authority of man in favor of their allegiance
to a higher power. There was constant danger that
their zeal would lead them to acts of indiscretion, and thus
furnish excuse, if not reason, for the assaults of persecutors,
who would have denounced them as law-breakers and workers
of sedition. Even half-hearted submission to the civil powers
would have been unwise at least, in view of the disfavor with
which the new sect had come to be regarded by their pagan
contemporaries. The voice of their inspired leaders was
heard, therefore, in timely counsel for humility and submission.
But there were then, as ever have there been, weightier
reasons than such as rest on motives of policy, requiring submission
to the established powers. Such is no less the law of
God than of man. Governments are essential to human existence;
they are recognized, given indeed, of the Lord; and
His people are in duty bound to sustain them.</p>

<p><b>19. Book of Mormon Teachings</b> concerning the duty of
the people as subjects of the law of the land are abundant
throughout the volume. However, as the civil and the ecclesiastical
powers were usually vested together, the king or
chief judge being also the high priest, there are comparatively
few admonitions of allegiance to the civil authority
as distinct from that of the priesthood. From the time of
Nephi, son of Lehi, to that of the death of Mosiah,&mdash;a period
of nearly five hundred years, the Nephites were ruled by a
succession of kings; during the remaining time of their
recorded history,&mdash;more than five hundred years, the people
were subject to judges of their own choosing. Under each
of these varieties of government, the secular laws were
rigidly enforced, the power of the state being supplemented
and strengthened by that of the Church. The sanctity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[433]</a></span>
with which the laws were regarded is illustrated in the
judgment pronounced by Alma upon Nehor, a murderer,
and a promoter of sedition and priestcraft:&mdash;"Thou art
condemned to die," said the judge, "according to the law
which has been given us by Mosiah, our last king; and they
have been acknowledged by this people; therefore, this
people must abide by the law."<a name="FNanchor_1244_1244" id="FNanchor_1244_1244"></a><a href="#Footnote_1244_1244" class="fnanchor">[1244]</a></p>

<p><b>20. Modern Revelation</b> requires of the Saints in the
present dispensation a strict allegiance to the civil laws.
In a communication dated August 1, 1831, the Lord said to
the Church:&mdash;"Let no man break the laws of the land, for
he that keepeth the laws of God hath no need to break the
laws of the land, Wherefore, be subject to the powers that
be, until he reigns whose right it is to reign, and subdues
all enemies under his feet."<a name="FNanchor_1245_1245" id="FNanchor_1245_1245"></a><a href="#Footnote_1245_1245" class="fnanchor">[1245]</a> At a later date, August 6,
1833, the voice of the Lord was heard again on this matter,
saying:&mdash;"And now, verily I say unto you concerning the
laws of the land, it is my will that my people should observe
to do all things whatsoever I command them; and
that law of the land which is constitutional, supporting
that principle of freedom in maintaining rights and privileges,
belongs to all mankind, and is justifiable before me;
Therefore, I, the Lord, justify you, and your brethren of
my church, in befriending that law which is the constitutional
law of the land."<a name="FNanchor_1246_1246" id="FNanchor_1246_1246"></a><a href="#Footnote_1246_1246" class="fnanchor">[1246]</a></p>

<p><b>21.</b> A question has many times been asked of the Church
and of its individual members, to this effect:&mdash;In the case
of a conflict between the requirements made by the revealed
word of God, and those imposed by the secular law, which
of these authorities would the members of the Church be
bound to obey? In answer, the words of Christ may be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[434]</a></span>
applied:&mdash;it is the duty of the people to render unto Cæsar
the things that are Cæsar's, and unto God the things that
are God's. At the present time, the Kingdom of Heaven
as an earthly power, with a reigning King exercising direct
and personal authority in temporal matters, has not been
established upon the earth; the branches of the Church as
such, and the members composing the same, are subjects of
the several governments within whose separate realms the
Church organizations exist. In this day of comparative
enlightenment and freedom, there is small cause for expecting
any direct interference with the rights of private worship
and individual devotion; in all civilized nations the
people are accorded the right to pray, and this right is
assured by what may be properly called a common law of
human-kind. No earnest soul is cut off from communion
with his God; and with such an open channel of communication,
relief from burdensome laws and redress for grievances
may be sought from the Power that holds control of
nations.</p>

<p><b>22.</b> Pending the over-ruling by Providence in favor of
religious liberty, it is the duty of the Saints to submit themselves
to the laws of their country. Nevertheless, they
should use every proper method, as citizens or subjects of
their several governments, to secure for themselves and for
all men the boon of freedom in religious duties. It is not
required of them to suffer without protest imposition by lawless
persecutors, or through the operation of unjust laws;
but their protests should be offered in legal and proper
order. The Saints have practically demonstrated their
acceptance of the doctrine that it is better to suffer evil
than to do wrong by purely human opposition to unjust
authority. And if by thus submitting themselves to the
laws of the land, in the event of such laws being unjust
and subversive of human freedom, the Saints be prevented<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[435]</a></span>
from doing the work appointed them of God, they are not
to be held accountable for the failure to act under the higher
law. The word of the Lord has been given explicitly defining
the position and duty of the people in such a contingency:&mdash;"Verily,
verily, I say unto you, that when I give
a commandment to any of the sons of men, to do a work
unto my name, and those sons of men go with all their
might, and with all they have, to perform that work, and
cease not their diligence, and their enemies come upon them,
and hinder them from performing that work; behold, it behoveth
me to require that work no more at the hands of those
sons of men, but to accept of their offerings; And the iniquity
and transgression of my holy laws and commandments,
I will visit upon the heads of those who hindered my work,
unto the third and fourth generation, so long as they repent
not and hate me, saith the Lord God."<a name="FNanchor_1247_1247" id="FNanchor_1247_1247"></a><a href="#Footnote_1247_1247" class="fnanchor">[1247]</a></p>

<p><b>23. An Illustration</b> of such suspension of Divine law is
found in the action of the Church regarding the matter of
plural or polygamous marriage. The practice referred to
was established as a result of direct revelation,<a name="FNanchor_1248_1248" id="FNanchor_1248_1248"></a><a href="#Footnote_1248_1248" class="fnanchor">[1248]</a> and many
of those who followed the same felt that they were divinely
commanded so to do. For ten years after plural marriage
had been introduced into Utah as a Church observance, no
law was enacted in opposition to the practice. Beginning
with 1862, however, Federal statutes were framed declaring
the practice unlawful and providing penalties therefor. The
Church claimed that these enactments were unconstitutional,
and therefore void, inasmuch as they violated the provision
in the national constitution which denies the government
power to make laws respecting any establishment of
religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.<a name="FNanchor_1249_1249" id="FNanchor_1249_1249"></a><a href="#Footnote_1249_1249" class="fnanchor">[1249]</a> Many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[436]</a></span>
appeals were taken to the national court of final resort, and
at last a decision was rendered sustaining the anti-polygamy
laws as constitutional and therefore binding. The Church,
through its chief officer, thereupon discontinued the practice
of plural marriage, and announced its action to the
world; solemnly placing the responsibility for the change
upon the nation by whose laws the renunciation had been
forced. This action has been approved and confirmed by the
official vote of the Church in conference assembled.<a name="FNanchor_1250_1250" id="FNanchor_1250_1250"></a><a href="#Footnote_1250_1250" class="fnanchor">[1250]</a></p>

<p><b>24. Teachings of the Church Today.</b>&mdash;Perhaps there can be
presented no better summary of the teachings of the
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints regarding its
relation to the civil power, and the respect due to the laws
of the land, than the official declaration of belief which
was issued by the Prophet Joseph Smith, and which has
been incorporated in the Doctrine and Covenants,&mdash;one of
the standard works of the Church, adopted by vote of the
Church as one of the accepted guides in faith, doctrine,
and practice.<a name="FNanchor_1251_1251" id="FNanchor_1251_1251"></a><a href="#Footnote_1251_1251" class="fnanchor">[1251]</a> It reads as follows:&mdash;</p>


<p class="center">"OF GOVERNMENTS AND LAWS IN GENERAL.</p>

<p>"1. We believe that governments were instituted of God
for the benefit of man, and that he holds men accountable
for their acts in relation to them, either in making laws or
administering them, for the good and safety of society.</p>

<p>"2. We believe that no government can exist in peace,
except such laws are framed and held inviolate as will
secure to each individual the free exercise of conscience,
the right and control of property, and the protection of life.</p>

<p>"3. We believe that all governments necessarily require
civil officers and magistrates to enforce the laws of the
same, and that such as will administer the law in equity
and justice, should be sought for and upheld by the voice
of the people (if a republic), or the will of the sovereign.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[437]</a></span></p>

<p>"4. We believe that religion is instituted of God, and
that men are amenable to him, and to him only, for the
exercise of it, unless their religious opinions prompt them
to infringe upon the rights and liberties of others; but we
do not believe that human law has a right to interfere in
prescribing rules of worship to bind the consciences of men,
nor dictate forms for public or private devotion; that the
civil magistrate should restrain crime, but never control
conscience; should punish guilt, but never suppress the
freedom of the soul.</p>

<p>"5. We believe that all men are bound to sustain and
uphold the respective governments in which they reside,
while protected in their inherent and inalienable rights by
the laws of such governments; and that sedition and rebellion
are unbecoming every citizen thus protected, and should
be punished accordingly; and that all governments have a
right to enact such laws as in their own judgment are best
calculated to secure the public interest, at the same time,
however, holding sacred the freedom of conscience.</p>

<p>"6. We believe that every man should be honored in his
station: rulers and magistrates as such, being placed for
the protection of the innocent, and the punishment of
the guilty; and that to the laws, all men owe respect and
deference, as without them peace and harmony would be
supplanted by anarchy and terror; human laws being instituted
for the express purpose of regulating our interests as
individuals and nations, between man and man, and divine
laws given of heaven, prescribing rules on spiritual concerns,
for faith and worship, both to be answered by man to
his Maker.</p>

<p>"7. We believe that rulers, states, and governments have
a right, and are bound to enact laws for the protection of
all citizens in the free exercise of their religious belief; but
we do not believe that they have a right in justice, to deprive
citizens of this privilege, or proscribe them in their opinions,
so long as a regard and reverence are shown to the
laws, and such religious opinions do not justify sedition nor
conspiracy.</p>

<p>"8. We believe that the commission of crime should be
punished according to the nature of the offense; that murder,
treason, robbery, theft, and the breach of the general<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[438]</a></span>
peace, in all respects, should be punished according to their
criminality, and their tendency to evil among men, by the
laws of that government in which the offense is committed;
and for the public peace and tranquillity, all men should
step forward and use their ability in bringing offenders
against good laws to punishment.</p>

<p>"9. We do not believe it just to mingle religious influence
with civil government, whereby one religious society
is fostered, and another proscribed in its spiritual privileges,
and the individual rights of its members as citizens, denied.</p>

<p>"10. We believe that all religious societies have a right
to deal with their members for disorderly conduct according
to the rules and regulations of such societies, provided that
such dealing be for fellowship and good standing; but we
do not believe that any religious society has authority to
try men on the right of property or life, to take from them
this world's goods, or to put them in jeopardy of either life
or limb, neither to inflict any physical punishment upon
them; they can only excommunicate them from their
society, and withdraw from them their fellowship.</p>

<p>"11. We believe that men should appeal to the civil
law for redress of all wrongs and grievances, where personal
abuse is inflicted, or the right of property or character
infringed, where such laws exist as will protect the same;
but we believe that all men are justified in defending themselves,
their friends, and property, and the government,
from the unlawful assaults and encroachments of all
persons, in times of exigency, where immediate appeal cannot
be made to the laws, and relief afforded.</p>

<p>"12. We believe it just to preach the gospel to the
nations of the earth, and warn the righteous to save themselves
from the corruption of the world; but we do not
believe it right to interfere with bond servants, neither
preach the gospel to, nor baptize them, contrary to the will
and wish of their masters, nor to meddle with or influence
them in the least, to cause them to be dissatisfied with their
situations in this life, thereby jeopardizing the lives of
men; such interference we believe to be unlawful and unjust,
and dangerous to the peace of every government allowing
human beings to be held in servitude."</p>

<h3>NOTES.</h3>


<blockquote>

<p><b>1. Insults to Paul and to Christ.</b>&mdash;See Acts xxiii, 1-5. "Scarcely had the
apostle uttered the first sentence of his defense, when, with disgraceful illegality,
Ananias ordered the officers of the court to smite him on the mouth. Stung by an
insult so flagrant, an outrage so undeserved, the naturally choleric temperament of Paul
flamed into that sudden sense of anger which ought to be controlled, but which can
hardly be wanting in a truly noble character. No character can be perfect which does
not cherish in itself a deeply-seated, though perfectly generous and forbearing, indignation
against intolerable wrong. Smarting from the blow, 'God shall smite thee,' he
exclaimed, 'thou whitewashed wall! What! Dost thou sit there judging me according
to the Law, and in violation of law biddest me to be smitten?' The language has been
censured as unbecoming in its violence, and has been unfavorably compared with the
meekness of Christ before the tribunal of his enemies. [See John xviii, 19-23.]
'Where,' asks St. Jerome, 'is that patience of the Savior, who&mdash;as a lamb led to the
slaughter opens not his mouth&mdash;so gently asks the smiter, "If I have spoken evil, bear
witness to the evil; but if well, why smitest thou me?" We are not detracting from the
apostle, but declaring the glory of God, who, suffering in the flesh, reigns above the
wrong and frailty of the flesh.' Yet we need not remind the reader that not once or
twice only did Christ give the rein to righteous anger, and blight hypocrisy and insolence
with a flash of holy wrath. The bystanders seemed to have been startled by the
boldness of St. Paul's rebuke, for they said to him, 'Dost thou revile the high priest of
God?' The apostle's anger had expended itself in that one outburst, and he instantly
apologized with exquisite urbanity and self-control. 'I did not know,' he said, 'brethren,
that he is the high priest'; adding that, had he known this, he would not have
addressed to him the opprobrious name of 'whited wall,' because he reverenced and
acted upon the rule of scripture, 'Thou shalt not speak ill of a ruler of thy people.'"&mdash;Farrar,
<cite>The Life and Work of St. Paul</cite>, pp. 539-540.</p>

<p><b>2. Peter's Teaching's Regarding Submission to Law.</b>&mdash;A special "duty
of Christians in those days was due respect in all things lawful, to the civil government....
Occasions there are&mdash;and none knew this better than an apostle who
had himself set an example of splendid disobedience to unwarranted commands [Acts
iii, 19, 31; v, 28-32; 40-42]&mdash;when 'we must obey God rather than men.' But those
occasions are exceptional to the common rule of life. Normally, and as a whole, human
law is on the side of divine order, and, by whomsoever administered, has a just claim to
obedience and respect. It was a lesson so deeply needed by the Christians of the day
that it is taught as emphatically by St. John [John xix, 11], and by St. Peter, as by
St. Paul himself. It was more than ever needed at a time when dangerous revolts were
gathering to a head in Judea; when the hearts of Jews throughout the world were burning
with a fierce flame of hatred against the abominations of a tyrannous idolatry; when
Christians were being charged with 'turning the world upside-down' [Acts xvii, 6];
when some poor Christian slave, led to martyrdom or put to the torture, might easily
relieve the tension of his soul by bursting into apocalyptic denunciations of sudden
doom against the crimes of the mystic Babylon; when the heathen, in their impatient
contempt, might wilfully interpret a prophecy of the final conflagration as though it
were a revolutionary and incendiary threat; and when Christians at Rome were, on this
very account, already suffering the agonies of the Neronian persecution. Submission,
therefore, was at this time a primary duty of all who wished to win over the heathen,
and to save the Church from being overwhelmed in some outburst of indignation which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[440]</a></span>
would be justified even to reasonable and tolerant pagans as a political necessity....
'Submit, therefore,' the apostle says, 'to every human ordinance, for the Lord's sake,
whether to the emperor as supreme [the name "king" was freely used of the emperor
in the provinces], or to governors, as missioned by him for punishment of malefactors
and praise to well-doers; for this is the will of God, that by your well-doing ye should
gag the stolid ignorance of foolish persons; as free, yet not using your freedom for a
cloak of baseness, but as slaves of God. 'Honor all men' as a principle; and as your
habitual practice, 'love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honor the King.'" [See I Peter
ii, 13-17.]&mdash;Farrar, <cite>Early Days of Christianity</cite>, pp. 89-90.</p>

<p><b>3. The Law of God, and the Law of Man.</b>&mdash;The teaching of the Church
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints respecting the duty of its members in obeying the
laws of the land wherein they live, is more comprehensive and definite than is that of
many other Christian sects. In January, 1899, an association of the free Evangelical
churches of England officially published "a common statement of faith in the form of
a new catechism." Touching the relation between church and state, the following
formal questions and prescribed answers occur:&mdash;</p>

<p>"36. Q.&mdash;What is a free church? A.&mdash;A church which acknowledges none but
Jesus Christ as Head, and, therefore, exercises its right to interpret and administer His
laws without restraint or control by the state.</p>

<p>"37. Q.&mdash;What is the duty of the church to the state? A.&mdash;To observe all the laws
of the state unless contrary to the teachings of Christ," etc.</p>

<p>According to the report of the committee in charge of the work of publication, the
catechism "represents, directly or indirectly, the beliefs of not less, and probably many
more, than sixty millions of avowed Christians in all parts of the world."</p>

<p><b>4. Discontinuance of Plural Marriage.</b>&mdash;The official act terminating the
practice of plural marriage among the Latter-day Saints was the adoption by the Church,
in conference assembled, of a manifesto proclaimed by the President of the Church.
The language of the document illustrates the law-abiding character of the people and the
Church, as is shown by the following clause:&mdash;"Inasmuch as laws have been enacted by
Congress forbidding plural marriages, which laws have been pronounced constitutional
by the court of last resort, I [President Wilford Woodruff] hereby declare my intention
to submit to those laws, and to use my influence with the members of the Church over
which I preside to have them do likewise." In the course of a sermon immediately
following the proclaiming of the manifesto, President Woodruff said
regarding the action taken:&mdash;"I have done my duty, and the nation of which we
form a part must be responsible for that which has been done in relation to that
principle" (i.e., plural marriage).</p>

<p><b>5. A Striking Instance of Submission to Secular Authority.</b>&mdash;"Governments
are instituted of God, sometimes by His direct interposition,
sometimes by His permission. When the Jews had been brought into subjection
by Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, the Lord commanded through the prophet
Jeremiah (xxvii, 4-8) that the people render obedience to their conqueror, whom
He called His servant; for verily the Lord had used the pagan king to chastise
the recreant and unfaithful children of the covenant. The obedience so enjoined
included the payment of taxes and extended to complete submission." See
"Jesus the Christ," p. 564, Note 2.</p></blockquote>

<h3>PRACTICAL RELIGION.</h3>

<blockquote>

<p><b>Article 13.</b>&mdash;We believe in being honest, true, chaste, benevolent, virtuous, and in
doing good to all men; indeed, we may say that we follow the admonition of Paul,&mdash;We
believe all things, we hope all things, we have endured many things, and hope to be
able to endure all things. If there is anything virtuous, lovely, or of good report or
praiseworthy, we seek after these things.</p></blockquote>


<p><b>1. Religion of Daily Life.</b>&mdash;In this article of their faith,
the Latter-day Saints declare their acceptance of a practical
religion; a religion that shall consist, not alone of professions
in spiritual matters, and belief as to the conditions
of the hereafter, of the doctrine of original sin and the
actuality of a future heaven and hell, but also, and more
particularly, of present and every-day duties, in which
respect for self, love for fellow-men, and devotion to God
are the guiding principles. Religion without morality, professions
of godliness without charity, church-membership
without an adequate responsibility as to individual conduct
in daily life, are but as sounding brass and tinkling cymbals&mdash;noise
without music, the words without the spirit
of prayer. "Pure religion and undefiled before God and
the Father is this, To visit the fatherless and widows in
their affliction, and to keep himself unspotted from the
world."<a name="FNanchor_1252_1252" id="FNanchor_1252_1252"></a><a href="#Footnote_1252_1252" class="fnanchor">[1252]</a> Honesty of purpose, integrity of soul, individual
purity, absolute freedom of conscience, willingness to do
good to all men even enemies, pure benevolence,&mdash;these are
some of the fruits by which the religion of Christ may be
known, far exceeding in importance and value the promulgation
of dogmas, and the enunciation of theories. Yet a
knowledge of things more than temporal, doctrines of spiritual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[442]</a></span>
matters, founded on revelation and not resting on the
sands of man's frail hypotheses, are likewise characteristic
of the true Church.</p>

<p><b>2. The Comprehensiveness of Our Faith</b> must appeal
to every earnest investigator of the principles taught by
the Church, and still more to the unprejudiced observer
of the results as manifested in the course of life characteristic
of the Latter-day Saints. Within the pale of the
Church there is a place for all truth,&mdash;for everything
that is praiseworthy, virtuous, lovely, or of good report.
The liberality with which the Church regards other
religious denominations; the earnestness of its teaching
that God is no respecter of persons, but that He will
judge all men according to their deeds; the breadth and
depth of its precepts concerning the state of immortality,
and the gradations of eternal glory awaiting the honest in
heart of all nations, kindred, and churches, civilized and
heathen, enlightened and benighted, have been set forth in
preceding lectures. We have seen further, that the belief
of this people carries them forward, even beyond the bounds
of all knowledge thus far revealed, and teaches them to
look with unwavering confidence for other revelation, truths
yet to be added, glories grander than have yet been made
known, eternities of powers, dominions, and progress,
beyond the mind of man to conceive or the soul to contain.
We believe in a God who is Himself progressive,
whose majesty is intelligence; whose perfection consists in
eternal advancement; the perpetual work of whose creation
stands "finished, yet renewed forever;"<a name="FNanchor_1253_1253" id="FNanchor_1253_1253"></a><a href="#Footnote_1253_1253" class="fnanchor">[1253]</a>&mdash;a Being who
has attained His exalted state by a path which now His
children are permitted to follow; whose glory it is their
heritage to share. In spite of the opposition of all the
sects, in the face of direct charges of blasphemy, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[443]</a></span>
Church proclaims the eternal truth, "<em>As man is, God once
was; as God is, man may become.</em>" With such a future,
well may man open his heart to the stream of revelation,
past, present, and to come; and truthfully should we be
able to say of every enlightened child of God, that he
"Beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things,
endureth all things."<a name="FNanchor_1254_1254" id="FNanchor_1254_1254"></a><a href="#Footnote_1254_1254" class="fnanchor">[1254]</a> As incidental to the declaration of
belief embodied in this article of faith, many topics relating
to the organization, precepts, and practice of the Church
suggest themselves. Of these the following may claim our
present attention.</p>

<p><b>3. Benevolence.</b>&mdash;Benevolence is founded on love for
fellow-men; it embraces, though it far exceeds charity, in
the ordinary sense in which the latter word is used. By the
Divine Teacher it was placed as second only to love for God.
On one occasion, certain Pharisees came to Christ, tempting
Him with questions on doctrine, in the hope that they could
entangle Him, and so make Him an offender against the
Jewish law. Their spokesman was a lawyer; note his question
and the Savior's answer:&mdash;"Master, which is the great
commandment in the law? Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt
love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy
soul, and with all thy mind. This is the first and great commandment.
And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love
thy neighbor as thyself. On these two commandments
hang all the law and the prophets."<a name="FNanchor_1255_1255" id="FNanchor_1255_1255"></a><a href="#Footnote_1255_1255" class="fnanchor">[1255]</a> The two commandments,
here spoken of as first and second, are so closely
related as to be virtually one, and that one:&mdash;"Thou shalt
love." He who abideth one of the two will abide both. For
without love for our fellows, it is impossible to please God.
Hence wrote John,&mdash;the Apostle of Love,&mdash;"Beloved, let us
love one another: for love is of God; and every one that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[444]</a></span>
loveth is born of God, and knoweth God. He that loveth not
knoweth not God, for God is love.... If a man say,
I love God, and hateth his brother, he is a liar; for he that
loveth not his brother whom he hath seen, how can he love
God whom he hath not seen? And this commandment have
we from him, That he who loveth God love his brother
also."<a name="FNanchor_1256_1256" id="FNanchor_1256_1256"></a><a href="#Footnote_1256_1256" class="fnanchor">[1256]</a></p>

<p><b>4.</b> But perhaps the grandest and most sublime of the
apostolic utterances concerning the love that saves, is found
in the epistle of Paul to the Saints at Corinth.<a name="FNanchor_1257_1257" id="FNanchor_1257_1257"></a><a href="#Footnote_1257_1257" class="fnanchor">[1257]</a> In our current
English translation of the Bible, the virtue which the
apostle declares superior to all the miraculous gifts of the
Spirit, and which is to continue after all the rest have
passed away, is designated as <em>charity</em>; but the original
word meant <em>love</em>; and surely Paul had in mind something
grander than mere alms-giving, as is evident from his expression:&mdash;"And
though I bestow all my goods to feed the
poor, ... and have not charity, it profiteth me
nothing."<a name="FNanchor_1258_1258" id="FNanchor_1258_1258"></a><a href="#Footnote_1258_1258" class="fnanchor">[1258]</a> Though a man speak with the tongue of angels;
though he possess the power of prophecy&mdash;the greatest of the
ordinary gifts; though he be versed in knowledge and understand
all mysteries; though his faith enable him to move
mountains; and though he give his all, including even his
life,&mdash;yet without love is he nothing. Charity, or alms-giving,
even though it be performed with the sincerest of
motives, devoid of all desire for praise or hope of return,
is but a feeble manifestation of the love that is to make
one's neighbor as dear to him as himself; the love that
suffers long; that envies not others; that vaunts not itself;
that knows no pride; that subdues selfishness; that rejoices
in the truth. When "that which is perfect" is come, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[445]</a></span>
gifts which have been bestowed in part only will be superseded.
"Perfection will then swallow up imperfection; the
healing power will then be done away, for no sickness will be
there; tongues and interpretations will then cease, for one
pure language alone will be spoken; the casting out of devils
and power against deadly poisons will not then be needed,
for in heaven circumstances will render them unnecessary.
But charity, which is the pure love of God, never faileth; it
will sit enthroned in the midst of the glorified throng,
clothed in all the glory and splendor of its native heaven."<a name="FNanchor_1259_1259" id="FNanchor_1259_1259"></a><a href="#Footnote_1259_1259" class="fnanchor">[1259]</a>
If man would win eternal life, he cannot afford to neglect
the duty of love to his fellow, for "Love is the fulfilling of
the law."<a name="FNanchor_1260_1260" id="FNanchor_1260_1260"></a><a href="#Footnote_1260_1260" class="fnanchor">[1260]</a></p>

<p><b>5. Benevolence Manifested by the Church.</b>&mdash;The Church
of the present day can point to a stupendous labor of
benevolence already accomplished and still in progress. One
of the most glorious monuments of its work is seen in the
missionary labor which has ever been a characteristic feature
of its activities. Actuated by no other motives than pure
love for humanity and a desire to fulfil the commands of
God respecting such, the Church sends out every year hundreds
of missionaries to proclaim the gospel of eternal life
to the world, without money or price. Multitudes of these
devoted servants have suffered contumely and insult at the
hands of those whom they seek to benefit; and not a few
have given their lives with the seal of the martyr upon
their testimony and work. The charity that manifests itself
in material giving is not neglected in the Church; indeed
this form of benevolence is impressed as a sacred duty upon
every Latter-day Saint. While each one is urged to impart
of his substance to the needy in his individual capacity, a
system of orderly giving has been developed within the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[446]</a></span>
Church; and of this some features are worthy of special
consideration.</p>

<p><b>6. Free-will Offerings.</b>&mdash;It has ever been characteristic
of the Church and people of God, that they take upon
themselves the care of the poor, if any such exist among
them. To subserve this purpose, as also to foster a spirit of
liberality, kindness, and benevolence, voluntary gifts and
free-will offerings have been asked of those who profess to
be living according to the law of God. In the Church
today, a systematic plan of giving for the poor is in operation.
Thus, in almost every ward or branch, an organization
among the women, known as the Relief Society,<a name="FNanchor_1261_1261" id="FNanchor_1261_1261"></a><a href="#Footnote_1261_1261" class="fnanchor">[1261]</a> is in
existence. Its purpose is in part to gather from the society
and from the members of the Church in general, contributions
of money and other property, particularly the commodities
of life, and to distribute such to the deserving and
needy, under the direction of the local officers in the priesthood.
But the Relief Society operates also on a plan of systematic
visitation to the houses of the afflicted, extending
aid in nursing, administering comfort in bereavement, and
seeking in every possible way to relieve distress. The good
work of this organization has won the admiration of many
who profess no connection with the Church; its methods
have been followed by other benevolent associations, and
the Society has been accorded a national status in the United
States.</p>

<p><b>7. The Fast Offerings</b> represent a still more general system
of donation. The Church teaches the efficacy of continual
prayer and of periodical fasting, as a means of acquiring
the humility that is meet for Divine approval; and a
monthly fast-day has been appointed for observance throughout
the Church. For many years, the first Thursday in
each month was so observed; but, with the object of securing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[447]</a></span>
a more general attendance at the fast-service, a beneficial
change has been introduced, and at present the first
Sunday of the month is so devoted. The Saints are asked
to manifest their sincerity in fasting by making an offering
on that day for the benefit of the poor; and, by common
consent, the giving of at least an equivalent of the meals
omitted by the fasting of the family is expected. These
offerings may be made in money, food, or other usable commodity;
they are received by the bishopric or its representatives,
and by the same authority are distributed to the
worthy poor of the ward or branch. In these and in numerous
other ways do the Latter-day Saints contribute of
their substance to the needy, realizing that the poor among
them may be the Lord's poor; and that, irrespective of
worthiness on the part of the recipient, want and distress
must be alleviated. The people believe that the harmony
of their prayers will become a discord if the cry of the poor
accompany their supplications to the throne of Grace.</p>

<p><b>8. Tithing.</b>&mdash;The Church recognizes today the doctrine of
tithe-paying, similar in its general provision to that taught
and practiced of old. Before considering the present
authorized practice in this matter, it may be instructive to
study the ancient practice of tithe-paying. Strictly speaking,
a tithe is a tenth, and such a proportion of individual
possessions appears to have been formerly regarded as the
Lord's due. The institution of tithing antedates even the
Mosaic dispensation, for we find both Abraham and Jacob
paying tithes. Abraham, returning from a victorious battle,
met Melchizedek king of Salem and "priest of the most
high God;" and, recognizing his priestly authority, "gave him
tithes of all."<a name="FNanchor_1262_1262" id="FNanchor_1262_1262"></a><a href="#Footnote_1262_1262" class="fnanchor">[1262]</a> Jacob made a voluntary vow with the Lord to
render a tenth of all that should come into his possession.<a name="FNanchor_1263_1263" id="FNanchor_1263_1263"></a><a href="#Footnote_1263_1263" class="fnanchor">[1263]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[448]</a></span></p>

<p><b>9.</b> The Mosaic statutes are explicit in requiring tithes:&mdash;"And
all the tithe of the land, whether of the seed of the
land, or of the fruit of the tree, is the Lord's; it is holy
unto the Lord.... And concerning the tithe of the
herd, even of whatsoever passeth under the rod, the tenth
shall be holy unto the Lord."<a name="FNanchor_1264_1264" id="FNanchor_1264_1264"></a><a href="#Footnote_1264_1264" class="fnanchor">[1264]</a> The tenth was to be paid
as it came, without search for good or bad; under some conditions,
however, a man could redeem the tithe by paying its
value in some other way, but in such a case he had to add a
fifth of the tithe. The tenth of all the property in Israel was
to be paid to the Levites, as an inheritance given in acknowledgment
of their service in the labor of the tabernacle; and
they in turn were to pay tithing on what they received, and
this tithe of the tithe was to go to the priests.<a name="FNanchor_1265_1265" id="FNanchor_1265_1265"></a><a href="#Footnote_1265_1265" class="fnanchor">[1265]</a> A second
tithe was demanded of Israel to be used for the appointed
festivals.<a name="FNanchor_1266_1266" id="FNanchor_1266_1266"></a><a href="#Footnote_1266_1266" class="fnanchor">[1266]</a> It is evident, that while no specific penalty for
neglect of the law of tithing is recorded, the proper observance
of the requirement was regarded as a sacred duty. In
the course of the reformation by Hezekiah, the people
manifested their repentance by an immediate payment of
tithes;<a name="FNanchor_1267_1267" id="FNanchor_1267_1267"></a><a href="#Footnote_1267_1267" class="fnanchor">[1267]</a> and so liberally did they give, that a great surplus
accumulated; observing which, Hezekiah enquired as to the
source of such plenty:&mdash;"And Azariah the chief priest of
the house of Zadok answered him, and said, since the people
began to bring the offerings into the house of the Lord, we
have had enough to eat, and have left plenty; for the Lord
hath blessed his people; and that which is left is this great
store." Nehemiah took care to regulate the tithe-paying of
the people;<a name="FNanchor_1268_1268" id="FNanchor_1268_1268"></a><a href="#Footnote_1268_1268" class="fnanchor">[1268]</a> and both Amos<a name="FNanchor_1269_1269" id="FNanchor_1269_1269"></a><a href="#Footnote_1269_1269" class="fnanchor">[1269]</a> and Malachi<a name="FNanchor_1270_1270" id="FNanchor_1270_1270"></a><a href="#Footnote_1270_1270" class="fnanchor">[1270]</a> chided the people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[449]</a></span>
for their neglect of this duty. Through the prophet last
named, the Lord charged the people with having robbed
Him; but promised them blessings beyond their capacity to
receive if they would return to their allegiance to Him:
"Will a man rob God? Yet ye have robbed me. But ye
say, Wherein have we robbed thee? In tithes and offerings.
Ye are cursed with a curse: for ye have robbed me, even
this whole nation. Bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse,
that there may be meat in mine house, and prove
me now herewith, saith the Lord of hosts, if I will not open
you the windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing, that
there shall not be room enough to receive it."<a name="FNanchor_1271_1271" id="FNanchor_1271_1271"></a><a href="#Footnote_1271_1271" class="fnanchor">[1271]</a> In visiting
the Nephites after His resurrection, the Savior told them of
these sayings of Malachi, repeating the words of the Jewish
prophet.<a name="FNanchor_1272_1272" id="FNanchor_1272_1272"></a><a href="#Footnote_1272_1272" class="fnanchor">[1272]</a> The Pharisees, at the time of Christ's ministry,
were particularly scrupulous in the matter of tithe paying,&mdash;even
to the neglect of the "weightier matters of the law,"&mdash;and
for this inconsistency they were severely rebuked by the
Master.<a name="FNanchor_1273_1273" id="FNanchor_1273_1273"></a><a href="#Footnote_1273_1273" class="fnanchor">[1273]</a></p>

<p><b>10.</b> In the present dispensation, the law of tithing has
been given a place of great importance; and particular blessings
have been promised for its faithful observance. This
day has been called by the Lord, "a day of sacrifice, and a
day for the tithing of my people; for he that is tithed shall
not be burned."<a name="FNanchor_1274_1274" id="FNanchor_1274_1274"></a><a href="#Footnote_1274_1274" class="fnanchor">[1274]</a> In a revelation, given through the Prophet
Joseph Smith, July 8, 1838, the Lord has explicitly set
forth His requirement of the people in this matter.<a name="FNanchor_1275_1275" id="FNanchor_1275_1275"></a><a href="#Footnote_1275_1275" class="fnanchor">[1275]</a></p>

<p><b>11. Consecration and Stewardship.</b>&mdash;The law of tithing,
as accepted and professedly observed by the Church today,
is after all but a lesser law, given by the Lord in consequence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[450]</a></span>
of the human weaknesses, selfishness, covetousness, and
greed, which prevented the Saints from accepting the higher
principles, according to which the Father would have His
children live. Specific requirements regarding the payment
of tithes were made through revelation in 1838; but seven
years prior to that time, the voice of the Lord had been
heard on the subject of consecration,<a name="FNanchor_1276_1276" id="FNanchor_1276_1276"></a><a href="#Footnote_1276_1276" class="fnanchor">[1276]</a> or the dedication of
all one's property, together with his time, talents, and
natural endowments, to the service of God, to be used as occasion
may require. This again is not new; to the present
dispensation the law of consecration is given as a re-enactment;
it was recognized and observed with profit in olden
times.<a name="FNanchor_1277_1277" id="FNanchor_1277_1277"></a><a href="#Footnote_1277_1277" class="fnanchor">[1277]</a> But even in the apostolic period, the doctrine of
consecration of property and common ownership was old;
thirty-four centuries before that time, the same principle
had been practiced by the patriarch Enoch and his people,
and with such success that "the Lord came and dwelt with
his people; ... And the Lord called his people Zion,
because they were of one heart and one mind, and dwelt in
righteousness; and there was no poor among them."<a name="FNanchor_1278_1278" id="FNanchor_1278_1278"></a><a href="#Footnote_1278_1278" class="fnanchor">[1278]</a> In
each of the instances cited,&mdash;that of the people of Enoch, and
that of the Saints in the early part of the Christian era,&mdash;we
learn of the unity of purpose and consequent power acquired
by the people who lived in this social order; they were "of
one heart and one mind." Through the spiritual strength
so attained, the apostles were able to perform many mighty
works;<a name="FNanchor_1279_1279" id="FNanchor_1279_1279"></a><a href="#Footnote_1279_1279" class="fnanchor">[1279]</a> and of Enoch and his followers we read that the
Lord took them unto Himself.<a name="FNanchor_1280_1280" id="FNanchor_1280_1280"></a><a href="#Footnote_1280_1280" class="fnanchor">[1280]</a></p>

<p><b>12.</b> The people of whom the Book of Mormon gives us
record also attained to the blessed state of equality, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[451]</a></span>
with corresponding results. The disciples, whom Christ had
personally commissioned, taught with power, and "they
had all things common among them, every man dealing
justly, one with another."<a name="FNanchor_1281_1281" id="FNanchor_1281_1281"></a><a href="#Footnote_1281_1281" class="fnanchor">[1281]</a> Further, we read of a general
conversion by which the people came to a condition of ideal
peace; "there were no contentions or disputations among
them.... And they had all things common among
them, therefore they were not rich and poor, bond and
free, but they were all made free, and partakers of
the heavenly gift."<a name="FNanchor_1282_1282" id="FNanchor_1282_1282"></a><a href="#Footnote_1282_1282" class="fnanchor">[1282]</a> They were so blessed, that of them
the prophet said:&mdash;"Surely there could not be a happier
people among all the people who had been created by the
hand of God."<a name="FNanchor_1283_1283" id="FNanchor_1283_1283"></a><a href="#Footnote_1283_1283" class="fnanchor">[1283]</a> But after nearly two centuries of this
happy condition, the people gave way to pride; some of them
yielded to a passion for costly apparel; then they refused to
longer have their goods in common; and straightway many
classes came into existence; dissenting sects were established;
and then began a rapid course of disruption, which led to
the extinction of the Nephite nation.<a name="FNanchor_1284_1284" id="FNanchor_1284_1284"></a><a href="#Footnote_1284_1284" class="fnanchor">[1284]</a></p>

<p><b>13. Stewardship in the Church Today.</b>&mdash;A system of unity
in temporal matters has been revealed to the Church in this
day; such is currently known as the Order of Enoch,<a name="FNanchor_1285_1285" id="FNanchor_1285_1285"></a><a href="#Footnote_1285_1285" class="fnanchor">[1285]</a> or the
United Order,<a name="FNanchor_1286_1286" id="FNanchor_1286_1286"></a><a href="#Footnote_1286_1286" class="fnanchor">[1286]</a> and is founded on the law of consecration.
As already stated, in the early days of the modern Church
the people demonstrated their inability to abide this law in
its fulness, and, in consequence, the lesser law of tithing
was given; but the Saints confidently await the day in which
they will devote, not merely a tithe of their substance, but
all that they have, and all that they are, to the service of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[452]</a></span>
their God; a day in which no man will speak of mine and
thine, but all things shall be theirs and the Lord's.</p>

<p><b>14.</b> In this expectation, they indulge no vague dream of
communism, encouraging individual irresponsibility, and
giving the idler an excuse for hoping to live at the expense
of the thrifty; but rather, a calm trust that in the promised
social order which God can approve, every man will be
a steward in the full enjoyment of liberty to do as he will
with the talents committed to his care; but with the sure
knowledge that an account of his stewardship will be required
at his hands. As far as the plan of this prospective
organization has been revealed, it provides that a person
entering the order shall consecrate to the Lord all that he
has, be it little or much, giving to the Church a deed of
his property sealed with a covenant that cannot be broken.<a name="FNanchor_1287_1287" id="FNanchor_1287_1287"></a><a href="#Footnote_1287_1287" class="fnanchor">[1287]</a>
The person thus having given his all, is to be made a steward
over a part of the property of the Church, according
to his ability to use it. The varying grades of occupation
will still exist; there will be laborers, whose qualifications
fit them best for common toil; and managers who have
proved their ability to lead and direct; some who can serve
the cause of God best with the pen, others with the plow;
there will be engineers and mechanics, artisans and artists,
farmers and scholars, teachers, professors, and authors;&mdash;every
one laboring as far as practicable in the sphere of his
choice, but each required to work, and to work where and
how he can be of the greatest service. His stewardship is
to be assured him by written deed, and as long as he is
faithful to his charge, no man can take it from him.<a name="FNanchor_1288_1288" id="FNanchor_1288_1288"></a><a href="#Footnote_1288_1288" class="fnanchor">[1288]</a> Of
the proceeds of his labors, every man may use as he requires
for the support of himself and his family; the surplus is to
be rendered to the Church for public and general works, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[453]</a></span>
for the assistance of those who are worthily deficient.<a name="FNanchor_1289_1289" id="FNanchor_1289_1289"></a><a href="#Footnote_1289_1289" class="fnanchor">[1289]</a> As
further illustrative of the uses to which the surplus is to be
devoted, we read:&mdash;"All children have claim upon their
parents for their maintenance until they are of age. And
after that they have claim upon the Church, or in other
words, upon the Lord's storehouse, if their parents have not
wherewith to give them inheritances. And the storehouse
shall be kept by the consecrations of the Church, and widows
and orphans shall be provided for, as also the poor.<a name="FNanchor_1290_1290" id="FNanchor_1290_1290"></a><a href="#Footnote_1290_1290" class="fnanchor">[1290]</a> Any
faithful steward, requiring additional capital for the improvement
of his work, has a claim for such upon the custodians
of the general fund, they in turn being held accountable
for their management, which constitutes their
stewardship.<a name="FNanchor_1291_1291" id="FNanchor_1291_1291"></a><a href="#Footnote_1291_1291" class="fnanchor">[1291]</a> Equal rights are to be secured to all. The
Lord said:&mdash;'And you are to be equal, or, in other words,
you are to have equal claims on the properties, for the
benefit of managing the concerns of your stewardships, every
man according to his wants, and his needs, inasmuch as his
wants are just; and all this for the benefit of the Church of
the living God, that every man may improve upon his talent,
that every man may gain other talents, yea, even an hundred
fold, to be cast into the Lord's storehouse, to become the
common property of the whole church.'"<a name="FNanchor_1292_1292" id="FNanchor_1292_1292"></a><a href="#Footnote_1292_1292" class="fnanchor">[1292]</a></p>

<p><b>15.</b> Freedom of agency is to be secured to every individual;
if he be unfaithful he will be dealt with according to
the prescribed rules of church discipline. A corresponding
power of self-government will be exercised by the several
stakes or other divisions of the Church, each having independent
jurisdiction over its own store-houses and its affairs
of administration,<a name="FNanchor_1293_1293" id="FNanchor_1293_1293"></a><a href="#Footnote_1293_1293" class="fnanchor">[1293]</a> all being subject to the general authorities<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[454]</a></span>
of the Church. Only the idler would suffer in such an
order as is here outlined; he shall surely meet the results of
his negligence. Against him the edict of the Almighty has
gone forth. We read in the revelations:&mdash;"Thou shalt not
be idle; for he that is idle shall not eat the bread nor wear
the garments of the laborer."<a name="FNanchor_1294_1294" id="FNanchor_1294_1294"></a><a href="#Footnote_1294_1294" class="fnanchor">[1294]</a> "The idler shall not have
place in the church except he repents and mends his ways."<a name="FNanchor_1295_1295" id="FNanchor_1295_1295"></a><a href="#Footnote_1295_1295" class="fnanchor">[1295]</a>
"And the inhabitants of Zion, also, shall remember their
labors, inasmuch as they are appointed to labor in all faithfulness;
for the idler shall be had in remembrance before the
Lord."<a name="FNanchor_1296_1296" id="FNanchor_1296_1296"></a><a href="#Footnote_1296_1296" class="fnanchor">[1296]</a></p>

<p><b>16. Social Order of the Saints.</b>&mdash;In view of the prevailing
conditions of social unrest, of the loud protest against
existing systems, whereby the distribution of wealth is
becoming more and more unequal,&mdash;the rich growing richer
from the increasing poverty of the poor, the hand of oppression
resting more and more heavily upon the masses, the
consequent dissatisfaction with governments, and the half-smothered
fires of anarchy discernible in almost every
nation,&mdash;may we not take comfort in the God-given promise
of a better plan&mdash;a plan which seeks without force or violence
to establish a natural equality, to take the weapons of
despotism from the rich, to aid the lowly and the poor,<a name="FNanchor_1297_1297" id="FNanchor_1297_1297"></a><a href="#Footnote_1297_1297" class="fnanchor">[1297]</a> and
to give every man an opportunity to live and to labor in the
sphere to which he is adapted? From the tyranny of wealth,
as from every other form of oppression, the truth will make
men free. To be partakers of such freedom, mankind must
subdue selfishness, which is one of the most potent enemies
of godliness.</p>

<p><b>17.</b> The Church teaches the necessity of proper social
organization, in harmony with the laws of the land; the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[455]</a></span>
sanctity of the institution and covenant of marriage as
essential to the stability of society; the fulfillment of
the Divine law with respect to the perpetuation of the
human family; and the importance of strictest personal
purity.</p>

<p><b>18. Marriage.</b>&mdash;The teachings of the scriptures concerning
the necessity of marriage are numerous and explicit.
"The Lord God said, It is not good that the man should be
alone;"<a name="FNanchor_1298_1298" id="FNanchor_1298_1298"></a><a href="#Footnote_1298_1298" class="fnanchor">[1298]</a> this comprehensive declaration was made concerning
Adam, immediately after his location in Eden; Eve was
given unto him, and the man recognized the necessity of a
continued association of the sexes in marriage, and said:&mdash;"Therefore
shall a man leave his father and his mother, and
shall cleave unto his wife; and they shall be one flesh."<a name="FNanchor_1299_1299" id="FNanchor_1299_1299"></a><a href="#Footnote_1299_1299" class="fnanchor">[1299]</a>
Neither of the sexes is complete in itself as a counterpart
of God. Of the creation of human kind we read:&mdash;"So
God created man in his own image, in the image of
God created he him; male and female created he them."<a name="FNanchor_1300_1300" id="FNanchor_1300_1300"></a><a href="#Footnote_1300_1300" class="fnanchor">[1300]</a>
The purpose of this dual creation is set forth in the
next verse of the sacred narrative:&mdash;"And God blessed
them; and God said unto them, Be fruitful and multiply
and replenish the earth."<a name="FNanchor_1301_1301" id="FNanchor_1301_1301"></a><a href="#Footnote_1301_1301" class="fnanchor">[1301]</a> Such a command would have
been meaningless and void if addressed to either of the
sexes alone; for only by the union of both is the propagation
of the species possible. And without the power of perpetuating
his kind, how insignificant would appear the
glory and majesty of man! How little can be accomplished
by the individual within the limited range of a single mortal
existence!</p>

<p><b>19.</b> Grand as may seem the achievements of a man who
is truly great, the culmination of his glorious heritage lies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[456]</a></span>
in the possibility of his leaving offspring from his own
being to continue, perchance, the triumphs of their sire.
And if such be true of mortals with respect to the things of
earth, how transcendently greater is the power of eternal
increase, as viewed in the light of revealed truth concerning
the un-ending progression of the future state! Truly the
apostle was wise when he said, "Neither is the man without
the woman, neither the woman without the man, in the
Lord."<a name="FNanchor_1302_1302" id="FNanchor_1302_1302"></a><a href="#Footnote_1302_1302" class="fnanchor">[1302]</a></p>

<p><b>20.</b> The Latter-day Saints accept the doctrine that
marriage is honorable,<a name="FNanchor_1303_1303" id="FNanchor_1303_1303"></a><a href="#Footnote_1303_1303" class="fnanchor">[1303]</a> and apply it as a requirement to all
who are not prevented by physical or other disability from
assuming the sacred responsibilities of the wedded state.
They consider, as part of the birthright of every worthy
man, the privilege and duty to stand as the head of a household,
the father of a posterity, which by the blessing of God
may never become extinct; and equally strong is the right
of every worthy woman to be a wife and a mother in the
family of mankind. In spite of the simplicity, reasonableness,
and naturalness of these teachings, false teachers have
arisen among men, declaring the pernicious doctrine that
the married state is but a carnal necessity, inherited by man
as an incident of his degraded nature; and that celibacy is a
mark of a higher state, more acceptable in the pure sight
of God. Concerning such the Lord has spoken in this
day:&mdash;"Whoso forbiddeth to marry is not ordained of God,
for marriage is ordained of God unto man ... that
the earth might answer the end of its creation; and that it
might be filled with the measure of man, according to his
creation before the world was made."<a name="FNanchor_1304_1304" id="FNanchor_1304_1304"></a><a href="#Footnote_1304_1304" class="fnanchor">[1304]</a></p>

<p><b>21. Celestial Marriage.</b>&mdash;Marriage, as regarded by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[457]</a></span>
Latter-day Saints, is ordained of God and designed to be an
eternal relationship of the sexes. With this people it is not
merely a temporal contract to be of effect on earth during
the mortal existence of the parties, but a solemn agreement
which is to extend beyond the grave. In the complete ceremony
of marriage, as prescribed by the Church, the man
and the woman are placed under covenant of mutual fidelity,
not "until death do you part," but "for time and for
all eternity." A contract as far reaching as this, extending
not only throughout time, but into the domain of the hereafter,
requires for its validation an authority superior to that
of earth; and such an authority is found in the holy priesthood,
which, given of God, is eternal. Any power less than
this, while perchance of effect in this life, is assuredly
void as to the state of the human soul beyond the grave.
As the Lord has said:&mdash;"All covenants, contracts, bonds,
obligations, oaths, vows, performances, connections, associations,
or expectations, that are not made, and entered
into, and sealed, by the Holy Spirit of promise, of him who
is anointed, both as well for time and for all eternity, and
that too most holy, by revelation, and commandment,
through the medium of mine anointed, whom I have
appointed on the earth to hold this power, ...
are of no efficacy, virtue, or force, in and after the resurrection
from the dead; for all contracts that are not made
unto this end, have an end when men are dead."<a name="FNanchor_1305_1305" id="FNanchor_1305_1305"></a><a href="#Footnote_1305_1305" class="fnanchor">[1305]</a> And, as
touching the application of the principle of earthly authority
for things of earth, and eternal authority for things
beyond the grave, to the sacred contract of marriage, the
revelation continues:&mdash;"Therefore, if a man marry him a
wife in the world, and he marry her not by me, nor by my
word, and he covenant with her so long as he is in the world,
and she with him, their covenant and marriage are not of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[458]</a></span>
force when they are dead, and when they are out of the
world; therefore they are not bound by any law when they
are out of the world; Therefore, when they are out of the
world, they neither marry, nor are given in marriage; but
are appointed angels in heaven, which angels are ministering
servants, to minister for those who are worthy of a far more,
and an exceeding, and an eternal weight of glory; For these
angels did not abide my law, therefore they cannot be
enlarged, but remain separately and singly, without exaltation
in their saved condition, to all eternity, and from
henceforth are not Gods, but are angels of God, for ever and
ever."<a name="FNanchor_1306_1306" id="FNanchor_1306_1306"></a><a href="#Footnote_1306_1306" class="fnanchor">[1306]</a></p>

<p><b>22.</b> This system of holy matrimony, involving covenants
as to time and eternity, is known distinctively as Celestial
Marriage,&mdash;the order of marriage that exists in the celestial
worlds. The sacred ordinance of celestial marriage is permitted
to those members of the Church only who are
adjudged worthy of participation in the special blessings of
the House of the Lord; for this ordinance, together with
others of eternal validity, is to be performed in the temples
which are reared and dedicated for such holy service.<a name="FNanchor_1307_1307" id="FNanchor_1307_1307"></a><a href="#Footnote_1307_1307" class="fnanchor">[1307]</a>
Children who are born of parents thus married are natural
heirs to the priesthood; "children of the covenant" they
are called; they require no ceremony of adoption or sealing
to insure them place in the posterity of promise. But the
Church sanctions marriages for earthly time only, and bestows
upon such the seal of the priesthood, among those who are
not admitted to the temples of the Lord, or who voluntarily
prefer the lesser and temporal order of matrimony.</p>

<p><b>23. Unlawful Associations of the Sexes</b> have been designated
by the Lord as among the most heinous of sins; and
the Church today regards individual purity in the sexual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[459]</a></span>
relation as an indispensable condition of membership. The
teachings of the Nephite prophet, Alma, concerning the
enormity of offences against virtue and chastity, are
accepted by the Latter-day Saints without modification; and
such are to the effect:&mdash;"That these things are an abomination
in the sight of the Lord; yea, most abominable above
all sins, save it be the shedding of innocent blood, or denying
the Holy Ghost."<a name="FNanchor_1308_1308" id="FNanchor_1308_1308"></a><a href="#Footnote_1308_1308" class="fnanchor">[1308]</a> The command:&mdash;"Thou shalt not
commit adultery,"&mdash;once written by the finger of God amid
the thunders and lightnings of Sinai, has been renewed as a
specific injunction in these the last days; and the penalty
of excommunication has been prescribed for the offender.<a name="FNanchor_1309_1309" id="FNanchor_1309_1309"></a><a href="#Footnote_1309_1309" class="fnanchor">[1309]</a>
Moreover, the Lord regards any approach to sexual sin as
inconsistent with the professions of those who have received
the Holy Spirit, for He has declared that "he that looketh on
a woman to lust after her, or if any shall commit adultery in
their hearts, they shall not have the Spirit, but shall deny
the faith."<a name="FNanchor_1310_1310" id="FNanchor_1310_1310"></a><a href="#Footnote_1310_1310" class="fnanchor">[1310]</a></p>

<p><b>24. Sanctity of the Body.</b>&mdash;The Church counsels its
members that each regard his body as "the temple of
God;"<a name="FNanchor_1311_1311" id="FNanchor_1311_1311"></a><a href="#Footnote_1311_1311" class="fnanchor">[1311]</a> and that he maintain its purity and sanctity as such.
He is taught that the Spirit of the Lord dwells not in unclean
tabernacles; and that, therefore, he is required to
live according to the laws of health, which constitute part
of the law of God. For the special guidance of His Saints,
the Lord has revealed a "Word of Wisdom"<a name="FNanchor_1312_1312" id="FNanchor_1312_1312"></a><a href="#Footnote_1312_1312" class="fnanchor">[1312]</a> unto the
people; in accordance with which they are counseled to eat
wholesome food only; to abstain from strong drink, hot
drinks, and all kinds of stimulants and narcotics; to eat
flesh but sparingly, and to maintain in all respects a healthful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[460]</a></span>
state of the physical organism. And, on condition of
their compliance with these behests, the Saints have been
promised, that all "Who remember to keep and do these
sayings, walking in obedience to the commandments, shall
receive health in their navel, and marrow in their bones,
and shall find wisdom and great treasures of knowledge,
even hidden treasures; and shall run and not be weary, and
shall walk and not faint; And I, the Lord, give unto them
a promise, that the destroying angel shall pass by them, as
the children of Israel."<a name="FNanchor_1313_1313" id="FNanchor_1313_1313"></a><a href="#Footnote_1313_1313" class="fnanchor">[1313]</a></p>

<h3>NOTES.</h3>


<blockquote>

<p><b>1. Love, the Fulfilling of the Law.</b>&mdash;"Peter says, 'Above all things have
fervent love [charity] among yourselves' [I Peter iv, 8]. <em>Above all things.</em> And John
goes farther, 'God is love' [I John iv, 8]. And you remember the profound remark which
Paul makes elsewhere, 'Love is the fulfilling of the law' [Rom. xiii, 10; Gal. v, 14].
Did you ever think what he meant by that? In those days men were working their
passage to heaven by keeping the ten commandments, and the hundred and ten other commandments
which they had manufactured out of them. Christ said, I will show you a
more simple way. If you do one thing, you will do these hundred and ten things
without ever thinking about them. If you love, you will unconsciously fulfil the whole
law.... Take any of the commandments, 'Thou shalt have no other gods before
me.' If a man love God you will not require to tell him that. Love is the fulfilling of
that law. 'Take not his name in vain.' Would he ever dream of taking his name in
vain if he loved him? 'Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy.' Would he not be
too glad to have one day in seven to dedicate more exclusively to the object of his affection?
Love would fulfil all these laws regarding God. And so if he loved man, you
would never think of telling him to honor his father and mother. He could never do
anything else. It would be preposterous to tell him not to kill. You could only insult
him if you suggested that he should not steal,&mdash;how could he steal from those he loved?
It would be superfluous to beg him not to bear false witness against his neighbor. If he
loved him it would be the last thing he would do. And you would never dream of
urging him not to covet what his neighbors had. He would rather they possessed it
than himself. In this way 'Love is the fulfilling of the law.'"&mdash;Drummond: <cite>The
Greatest Thing in the World</cite>.</p>

<p><b>2. Charity and Love.</b>&mdash;"According to the etymology and original usage,
<em>beneficence</em> is the doing well, <em>benevolence</em> the wishing or willing well to others; but <em>benevolence</em>
has come to include <em>beneficence</em> and to displace it.... <em>Charity</em>, which
originally meant the purest love for God and man (as in I Cor. xiii), is now almost universally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[461]</a></span>
applied to some form of <em>alms-giving</em> and is much more limited in meaning than
<em>benevolence</em>."&mdash;<cite>Standard Dictionary.</cite></p>

<p><em>Charity</em> means "properly, love, and hence acts of kindness. The word never occurs
in the Old Testament; in the New Testament it is always, with one exception, synonymous
with love, and in every case the love of man toward his fellow man, and to that
which is good (see especially I Cor. xiii). The 'feasts of charity' in Jude 12, are commonly
understood to be the <i lang="el" xml:lang="el">agapæ</i>, or 'love-feasts,' which were prevalent in the early
church, and which consisted in a simple fraternal meeting for worship, and an equally
simple social repast."&mdash;<cite>Bible Dictionary</cite>, Cassell.</p>

<p>"Charity is only a little bit of love; one of the innumerable avenues of love, and
there may even be, and there is a great deal of charity without love. It is a very easy
thing to toss a copper to a beggar on the street; it is generally an easier thing than not to
do it.... We purchase relief from the sympathetic feelings roused by the spectacle
of misery, at the copper's cost. It is too cheap&mdash;too cheap for us, and often too
dear for the beggar. If we really loved him, we would either do more for him or less."&mdash;Drummond:
<cite>The Greatest Thing in the World</cite>.</p>

<p><b>3. Man's Relationship to God.</b>&mdash;"'Mormonism' claims an actual and literal
relationship of parent and child between the Creator and man&mdash;not in the figurative sense
in which the engine may be called the child of its builder; not the relationship of a thing
mechanically made to the maker thereof; but the connection between father and offspring.
In short it is bold enough to declare that man's spirit being the offspring of Deity, and
man's body though of earthy components yet being in the very image and likeness of
God, man even in his present degraded&mdash;aye, fallen condition&mdash;still possesses, if only in
a latent state, inherited traits, tendencies and powers that tell of his more than royal
descent; and that these may be developed so as to make him, even while mortal, in a
measure Godlike.</p>

<p>"But 'Mormonism' is bolder yet. It asserts that in accordance with the inviolable
law of organic nature&mdash;that like shall beget like, and that multiplication of numbers and
perpetuation of species shall be in compliance with the condition 'each after his kind,'
the child may achieve the former status of the parent, and that in his mortal condition
man is a God in embryo. However far in the future it may be, what ages may elapse,
what eternities may pass before any individual now a mortal being may attain the rank
and sanctity of godship, nevertheless man carries in his soul the possibilities of such
achievement; even as the crawling caterpillar or the corpse-like chrysalis holds the latent
possibility, nay, barring destruction in an earlier stage, the certainty indeed, of the
winged imago in all the glory of maturity.</p>

<p>"'Mormonism' claims that all nature, both on earth and in heaven, operates on a
plan of advancement; that the very Eternal Father is a progressive Being; that his perfection,
while so complete as to be incomprehensible by man, possesses this essential
quality of true perfection&mdash;the capacity of eternal increase. That therefore, in the far
future, beyond the horizon of eternities perchance, man may attain the status of a God.
Yet this does not mean that he shall be then the equal of the Deity we worship, nor that
he shall ever overtake those intelligences that are already beyond him in advancement;
for to assert such would be to argue that there is no progression beyond a certain stage
of attainment, and that advancement is a characteristic of low organization and inferior
purpose alone. We believe that there was more than the sounding of brass or the tinkling
of wordy cymbals in the fervent admonition of the Christ to his followers&mdash;'Be ye
therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect.'"&mdash;<cite>The Philosophy
of Mormonism</cite>: The Author, in <cite>Improvement Era</cite>, vol. iv, pp. 464-465.</p></blockquote>

Saints. It signifies, not alone a majority or such a number of persons of any organized
body as is requisite for authoritative action, but the organized body itself. The Church
regards a quorum as "a council or an organized body of the priesthood," e. g. <em>an elders'
quorum; the quorum of the Twelve Apostles</em>, etc. (See Standard Dictionary.)</p></div>
